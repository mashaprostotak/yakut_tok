# Monolingual Sakha Corpus Analysis
## Analysis of Yakut (Sakha) Language Text Corpus

### Introduction

This document summarizes the findings from our analysis of a monolingual Sakha language corpus. The analysis examines sentence length characteristics, word frequency distributions, and vocabulary statistics to provide insights into the structural and lexical properties of Sakha text.

### Dataset

The analysis was performed on a large Sakha text corpus:
- **Corpus name**: yakut_clean.txt
- **Size**: 25.5 MB
- **Total sentences**: 45,246
- **Analysis sample**: Random sample of 10,000 sentences (22% of corpus)

### Key Findings

#### Sentence Structure Analysis

**Character Length Distribution:**
- Mean sentence length: 318.9 characters
- Standard deviation: 294.4 characters
- Median: 232.0 characters
- Range: 16 to 8,612 characters

**Word Length Distribution:**
- Mean words per sentence: 39.2 words
- Standard deviation: 35.7 words
- Median: 29.0 words
- Range: 2 to 1,024 words

The relatively high standard deviations in both character and word counts indicate significant variability in sentence lengths across the corpus. The median values being lower than the means suggests a right-skewed distribution, with most sentences being shorter while a smaller number of very long sentences pull the average higher.

#### Vocabulary Analysis

**Corpus Size and Vocabulary:**
- Total word tokens in sample: 391,989
- Unique words (vocabulary size): 113,191
- Vocabulary diversity ratio (unique/total): 0.2888

**Word Frequency Characteristics:**
- Most frequent words: "да" (3,430), "диэн" (3,329), "уонна" (3,314), "–" (2,224), "Ол" (1,675)
- Hapax legomena (words occurring once): 80,422 (71.05% of vocabulary)
- The high percentage of hapax legomena indicates a rich vocabulary with many rare words

**Word Length in Vocabulary:**
- Mean word length: 9.43 characters
- Median word length: 9.0 characters
- Most common word length: 9 characters

#### Vocabulary Coverage

The analysis of vocabulary coverage reveals insights into the efficiency of the lexicon:

- 50% corpus coverage: achieved with approximately 1,060 most frequent words
- 80% corpus coverage: achieved with approximately 9,800 most frequent words
- 90% corpus coverage: achieved with approximately 25,000 most frequent words
- 95% corpus coverage: achieved with approximately 46,000 most frequent words

This demonstrates the typical Zipfian distribution found in natural languages, where a relatively small number of high-frequency words account for a disproportionately large portion of text coverage.

### Word Structure Observations

Sakha, as an agglutinative Turkic language, displays distinctive structural characteristics:

1. **Word Length**: With an average word length of 9.43 characters, Sakha words are notably longer than those typically found in non-agglutinative languages (e.g., English averages around 5 characters per word)

2. **Morphological Complexity**: The high average word length reflects Sakha's agglutinative nature, where grammatical information is added to words through suffixes rather than through separate words

3. **Word Formation**: Many of the longest words in the corpus demonstrate the agglutinative nature of Sakha, with multiple morphemes combined into single orthographic units

### Implications for NLP Applications

These findings have several implications for natural language processing applications for Sakha:

1. **Tokenization Approaches**: Standard tokenization methods may be suboptimal for Sakha. Given the agglutinative nature and long word lengths, subword tokenization methods (like BPE or SentencePiece) would likely be more effective than word-level tokenization

2. **Vocabulary Size Considerations**: The large vocabulary size (113,191 unique words in just a 10,000 sentence sample) suggests that open-vocabulary approaches or subword modeling would be necessary for effective NLP applications

3. **Data Sparsity**: The high proportion of hapax legomena (71.05%) indicates significant data sparsity challenges. This suggests that data augmentation techniques or transfer learning from related languages might be beneficial

4. **Language Model Architecture**: The long average sentence length (39.2 words) may require NLP models with longer context windows than those typically used for languages with shorter average sentence lengths

### Conclusion

The analysis of the Sakha monolingual corpus reveals a language with rich morphological structure, evident in its long average word length and high vocabulary diversity. The corpus displays typical Zipfian distribution characteristics, with a small set of high-frequency words accounting for a significant portion of the text.

The agglutinative nature of Sakha presents both challenges and opportunities for NLP applications. While the morphological complexity increases vocabulary size and data sparsity, it also allows for more information to be packed into individual words, potentially enabling more efficient representation with subword tokenization approaches.

These insights will inform preprocessing strategies, architecture decisions, and evaluation metrics for natural language processing applications targeted at the Sakha language.
