València (; ) is a city in the Autonomous Community of Valencia and the province of Valencia.
The third largest city in Spain after Madrid and Barcelona.
It is located at the fall of the partially drained river Turia into the Mediterranean Sea.
History
The city was founded by the Romans in 138 B.C.E., even though Greek and Carthagean settlements existed at the site of the city.
In the first century B.C.E., the city was besieged and captured by the Luzitans, who almost destroyed the settlement.
Shortly after the defeat of the rebellion, the Roman consul Decim Yuni Brutus Callaik rebuilt the city and called Valencia, which, in addition to the direct translation of the Fortress, also meant a good omen.
The ancient Valentia flourished during the reign of Emperor Augustus, during which time the new colony began to develop rapidly in the cultural and commercial fields, thanks to its location on the important trading road Via Sucronense.
The Roman period of Valencia &apos; s history ended in 413 when Valencia was captured by the Westgotts (the other Roman fortresses of the region, in particular Sagunt, fell).
In 714, the city was won by the Moors, including the city as part of the Kordovsky Caliphate.
Under Islamic rule, Valencia's active development, which was virtually halted during the West Rupee era, resumed.
By 718, the city had a population of 15,000.
The beginning of the 11th century is the era of the highest flourishing of Mauritanian Valencia, which became the capital of the Mauritanian kingdom formed after the collapse of the caliphate.
During the nearly five-century period (with a brief break in the late 11th century) of the Moor, a network of irrigation canals was established, urban walls (1021-1061) were rebuilt, impressive public buildings were built (to date, Arab baths were preserved) and the city became one of the centres of Mediterranean trade.
Population
The city is mostly Spanish-speaking, but the government is promoting Valencian language, and the population is growing to a large extent thanks to immigration.

Afife Jale (1902, Istanbul – 24 July 1941) was a Turkish theatrical actress known as the first Muslim theatre actress in Turkey.
Afife Jalae was born in 1902 in Istanbul.
Afifa had a sister and brother, Behiye Salâh.
Afifa studied at Istanbul Industrial School for Girls, but dreamed of becoming an actress.
At the time, in the Ottoman Empire, Turkish Muslim women could not play on the stage, only by decree of the Ministry of the Interior.
Only non-Muslim women of Greek, Armenian and Jewish origin could act.[1]
Afifa's father was opposed to her daughter's theatre career because he thought she was unprospecting.
After disobeying her father, Afifa escaped from her parents' home and became an intern at the newly created Conservatory.
The Conservatory opened courses for Muslim women in the actress profession at that time.
It was meant that they would only play for women's audiences.
When they lost their jobs, they found themselves in a difficult financial situation, with acute headaches.
Pity for morphine after her doctor prescribed her morphine-based meds.[1]
In 1923, Mustafa Kemal, the founder of the proclaimed Republic of Turkey, raised the issue of prohibitions against Muslim women.
The lifting of the bans brought Afife back to the theater.
However, her addiction to drugs did not go free and worsened her condition, which eventually led to her leaving the stage again.[1]
Family life
After leaving the scene, Afife Jala became completely impoverished.
In 1928 she met musician Pinar (Selahattin Pjnar) (1902–1960).
They married in 1929 and moved to an apartment in Fatikh, Istanbul.
However, their marriage did not work out and the couple divorced in 1935.
Afifa's addiction to drugs also affected her divorce.
After her divorce, she went to Bakyrkei Psychiatric Hospital to treat her drug addiction, where she spent her last years.
Afifa Jala died on July 24, 1941.
Heritage
In 1987, journalist Nezihe Araz (1922–2009) wrote a play called "Afife Jale", which was played on stage.

Sabiha Gökčen; 22 March 1913 (19130322), Bursa - 22 March 2001, Ankara) was the first female pilot in Turkey at the age of 23 and the first female fighter pilot in Turkey.
Biography
Early years
According to Turkish sources and interviews with Sabihi Goekchen herself, she was the daughter of Mustafa Izzet Bey and Hiriye Khan, who were ethnic Bosniacs.[4] Journalist Grant Dink wrote an article entitled "The Myina Sabihi-Hatoun", in which former resident Gaziantepa, Ripsima Sebiljian, claimed to be a relative of Gökchen, implying her Armenian lineage.[5][6][7] [8] Official Turkish sources and the other foster daughter of Atatürk, Ulkyu Adatepe (dead in a car crash on 1 August 2012) challenged this version.[9][11] [11]
Careers and introductions to Atatürk
During his visit to Atatürk Burza in 1925, Sabiha was 12 years old.
After reading her biography and learning about her poor and difficult life, Ataturk decided to adopt her, asking her brother's permission, as Sabiha would move to the President's palace in Ankara, where she would live with the other daughters of Atatürk, Zehra, Afet, and Rukia.
Sabiha graduated from a primary school in Ankara and the Uscudar School for Girls (`sküdar Kjz Lisesi') in the Istanbul district of Uskudar.
On 19 December 1934, Ataturk gave her the name Goekchen (Tour).
Gök is a sky.
At the time, however, Sabiha had nothing to do with the sky and the planes.
Atatürk has often paid attention to aviation and has also followed the foundation of the Turkish Air Navigation Association.
Sabiha was with Atatürk at the opening ceremony of the Türkku flight school ("Turkbirds") on May 5, 1935, part of which was a show of airplanes and parachutists invited from foreign countries.
Later, Ataturk asked Sabiha if she wanted to be a pilot, and she nodded, saying, "I'm really ready right now."
Ataturk instructed the director of the Fouad Bullje flight school to register Goekchen as the first female intern, and soon obtained a pilot's license.
Together with seven other students, Goekchen was sent to the USSR to model a fixed wing.
When Sabiha was in Moscow, she learned that Zehra had died and immediately returned to Turkey, leaving her education for a while.

Yazilikaya (, ) is a shrine in the mountains near Bogazköi in Central Anatolia, Turkey.
Research
It was discovered by French scientist S. Texier in 1838.
It was studied from 1838 to 1839.
The inscriptions were deciphered and read by French researcher E. Laroche from 1952 to 1969.
The earliest parts of the complex and the most ancient pieces of ceramic found in the excavations at Yazilaya are from the 15th century B.C.E., but the main structures, inscriptions, sculptures, and topography of the gods were created during the reign of the penultimate Hett king of Tudhalia IV in 1250 - 1220 B.C.E.
It consists of a central building, to which a temple of the same type is attached as the temples of the capital Hettusas, and a side space with images of a number of nameless gods and demons.
This side space is the oldest part of the entire shrine created before Tudhalia IV ruled.
It was remodeled several times until the end of the Hett Kingdom when the figures of lion-headed demons were removed at the entrance to the premises.
A reeliff who depicts the 12 gods of the underground kingdom.
In the central temple part of Yazylaka, on the cliffs, is the hurrit pantheon of the gods: the god of Teshub storm with its dearest gods, the Hurritan Ishtar, the Shawshaw, the gods of the moon and the sun, and others.
The inscriptions containing the Hurritan names of the gods and some other Hurritic words are done by the Hett (Lubian) hieroglyphs.
The shrine and temple of Yazylyka were used by the last Hetta kings to perform the peaceful cult of their Hurrit dynasty, which was of Hurrithian origin, the most impressive example of the monumental style, characterized by a combination of Hurritic and Luvian South Malasia elements, which continued in the art of southern Asia Minor and Syria and after the destruction of the Kingdom of Hett.

The inscription of the Great Xerxes on the Fortress Wall
Van's fortress (arm.
Kela Wanê, also known as Van Citadel, is a massive stone fortification structure built in the ancient kingdom of Urartu in the 9th to 7th centuries B.C.E.
The fortress is about 1,800 m long, 120 m high, 80 m wide.[1]
From the windows of the fortress, there is a view of the ruins of Tushpa, the ancient Urart capital of the 9th century.
A number of such strengthenings were built during the time of Urartu.
They are usually located on mountain slopes in modern Armenia, Turkey and Iran.
At different times, the Ahemenides, Armenians, Parthians, Romans, Sasanids, Persians, Byzantines, Arabs, Seljuks, Turks, and Russians owned the fortress.
Van's ancient fortress is located west of Wang and east of Lake Wang in Wang Province Turkey.
The lower walls of Van's fortress were built from basalt, the rest from cheese bricks.
Such fortresses were used to protect against local rulers, not to defend against foreign armies.
The ruins of this fortress are on the street of the modern city of Wang, where they support the walls built in the medieval era.
Near the fortress at the level of the rock, the three-worded inscription of the Persian king Xerx of the Great, dated from the fifth century B.C.E. The inscription is almost in perfect condition and divided into three columns of 27 rows.
The text is written from left to right in ancient Persian, Babylon and Eeam languages.
It's the only known Ahemenid inscription outside of Iran.
The inscription was first published by French Eastern scientist Eugene Burnuf in 1836.
The three-worded text of the inscription helped decipher the texts of ancient Persian clinking.[4]

Lagary rocket flight in the 17th century gravel
Lagâri Hasan ¡elebi () is a 17th-century legendary Osman airliner who, according to the only written testimony of traveler Evelya Cheleby, conducted the first successful manned flight of the missile.
He allegedly took off with an improvised powder rocket 300 metres and landed safely at sea, for which he was rewarded by the sultan.
Biography
Eulia Celeby reports that in 1633, Lagary Hassan Celeby prepared a seven-leck-long cone-like missile (1 Egyptian elbow = 52.4 cm), using 7 containers with 64.145 kg (50 occa) of gunpowder.
It was placed in a gun at Saraibourne Cape at the foot of the Sultan Palace of Topkapa.
The missile was allegedly launched on the occasion of the birth of the daughter of Sultan Mourad IV.
The missile, along with Lagari, was reported to have flown 300 metres in the air for 20 seconds.
Lagary landed on the water with homemade wings that played the role of parachute and sailed to the shore.
The Sultan rewarded him with gold and enrolled him in the Ottoman army.
Later, he was exiled to the lands of the North Prythonorium (now Ukraine).
Lagary also had a brother, Hesarfen Ahmet Cheleby, a design scientist, who flew through Bosphorus on homemade wings.
In culture
The 1996 Turkish Art Film "Istanbul under My Wings" (in English) describes the lives of Lagari Hassan Chelebi and his brother and comrade Hesarfen, as well as the life of Ottoman society at the beginning of the 17th century, according to the records of Evelya Chelebi.
Lagary's flight story was verified by an experiment in "The Legend Destroyers" on November 11, 2009, in the issue of "Crash and Burn." However, the show did not accurately follow the records of Evelya Cheleby, and the final design of the missile did not use Lagary-era materials.
However, the Destroyer Team explains this lack of information in the source.

Burebista was king of Dakia in 82 B.C.E., 44 B.C.E.
Association of Heto-Dak Tribes
In the first half of the first century B.C.E., heto-daks reached a high level of development.
There has been a shift towards a new trade-based economy.
Strong ties with the Greek ethnic groups have helped to unite the tribes.
Another major cause was the threat of conquest, with celts increasing from the west and north-west, and in the east, skeefs, bastards, and sarmats were under pressure in the ghet area.
But the most dangerous were the Romans, who came close to the Daco-Goet territories after the conquest of Greece and Macedonia.
All these factors contributed to the reunification of the Heto-Dak tribes under the leadership of the Burebistas.
His right hand in the government of the state was that of high priest Dekenei.
Strabon reports on the fate of the Burundians:
State of Burebistas
Dak State during the reign of the Burebistas, 82 B.C.E.
The main core of the new state was located in the south of the present Transylvania in the Orashtia Mountains, well protected by natural barriers.
There were also significant mineral reserves.
The core of the State has been considerably strengthened.
According to historians, [the source does not indicate 1,237 days] the area of about 150 km2 has been turned into a powerful fortress, which is indicative of the centralization of power.
Starting with the Orashtia Mountains, the Burebistas' power extended to all the lands occupied by the Heto Daks, and to the east the territory extended to the Bug River.
In the south of Burebista, according to Strabon, raided the borders of the Roman province of Macedonia, and in the north-west successfully fought with the Celts and even the tribe of fighting that lived in the territory of the Czech Republic.
Strabon, on the other hand, reports that the king's high priest, fortune-teller and chief counsellor was a man named Decane, whom he worshipped as a god; he forced the daks to cut off the vines and "live without wine".
The end of the reign of the Burebists
According to Strabon, Burebista was killed in a mutiny.
It was probably organized by the disgruntled Burebist policy of strengthening the centralized power of the aristocrat.
But we can't rule out Rome's organization.
After the death of the Burebistas, the state fell into four parts.
The historic significance of the Burebista era is great.
He was able to create the first unified State of Heto Dacs, which has spread throughout the habitat of these tribes.
However, his tribal union had proved to be short-lived and had not evolved into a fully-fledged and sustainable State entity.
More than a century after the death of the Burebistas, Desebal continued his business, but the final result of his activities was his military defeat and his transformation into a Roman province.

Ferdinand de Soscuur (February 26, 1857, 1857, 1116) was a Swiss linguist who laid the foundation for the sevenology and structural linguistics at the origin of the Geneva Language School.
Ferdinand de Sossüra's ideas, often called the father of the 20th century linguistics, have had a significant impact on the humanitarian thought of the 20th century as a whole, inspiring the birth of structuralism.
The main work of F. de Sossür is "Cours de linguistique générale".
The "Course of Common Linguistics" was published posthumously in 1916 by Charles Balley and Albert Sechet, on the basis of the University Lectures of Sossür. Bally and Seshe may be considered co-authors to some extent, since Sossour had no intention of publishing such a book, and there seems to be much to be added to its composition and content by publishers (there is much that is not in the detailed notes of the Sossür Lectures that we know, although, of course, he could share ideas with colleagues in private conversations).

Transcriticism in linguistics is the transmission by letter of a set of written signs (phonetic alphabet) of the elements of a speech (phone, allofons, sounds).
In linguistic theory and practice, transcription has a variety of applications.
Transcrypting the sound of the reader &apos; s native language
The transcription may transmit signs taken from an alphabet, pronunciation in the language of members of the same language community (ethnos, sub-ethinos, inhabitants of a region or settlement) that uses this alphabet, i.e., recording the sound of the user &apos; s own language or version (dialexta, idiolexta).
Thus, the Russian version of Cyril (sometimes modified to convey sound more accurately) is used in Russian textbooks in Russian, language skills (in Russian material) and Russian dictionary.
By means of this recording, readers are provided with the general rules of pronunciation (literical pronunciation) and with the particulars of pronunciation specific to (1) individual words, words, letters and combinations of sounds, (2) groups of the population allocated to areas of residence, mother tongue and/or dialect, age, etc.[1]
It is also easier for speakers of other languages (especially those with alphabetical-fonetic writing systems) to read the pronunciation recorded by their mother tongues, and English-language instructional dictionarys for schoolchildren and students in the United Kingdom and the United States often include the transcription by means of a modified Latin (English) alphabet supplemented by the upper- and sub-structural impact signs and the length of vowels.[2]
Several types of transcription are identified by linguisticians.
The basic meaningal features of pronunciation, expressed in contrast to the background, give rise to a genomic transcription.
It makes it possible to distinguish sounds that differ from a minimum set of sounds, such as the Russian words have fallen [fall] and the floor [sex], the pat [pat] and the fall [pat'] (the latter with the deafening and softness of the final okay) or the different pronunciations of the word bunny with [c] or [N]. In weak positions, the genomic transcript takes into account the withdrawal of contrasts between the background. For couples with the sillyness of the Russian consents, this position is at the absolute end of the word: so the chade and the chat room sounds in the form of a commemorative paede are the same and their transcription will coincide with the view [of the chat].
A non-crash closed (uplift) vowel, formed in revenge by Orphographic and E after soft consents, is described as [a]: For a more subtle transmission of features of regional, chronological or other pronunciation options, a phonical transcription is used. It more accurately depicts the interaction of sounds in the voice stream — quantitative and qualitative reduction, the combination of vowel and agreeable (e.g., nationalization and labification), partial or complete assimilation of sounds in the place and the manner in which they are produced.

Dar &apos; i ( &quot; Dar &quot; ; Farsi &quot;, Kabul &quot;, &quot; Afghan Persian &quot; ) is the language of Afghan Tajiks, Hazareans, Charaymaks, and some other ethnic groups.
One of the two national languages of Afghanistan.
It is mainly distributed in its northern and central provinces, Kabul, northern Pakistan and eastern Iran.
It is a language of inter-ethnic communication in Afghanistan.
The total number of speakers is over 12 million (2011, estimate).
Dari's mother tongue accounts for about 50% of Afghanistan's population.
Most professionals are considered to be the local Afghan version of Tajik and Persian.
From the Iranian version of Persian, Dari is essentially a bacterium (mainly vocalism), there are also small and almost invisible differences in language and grammar.
It is almost identical to the Tajik language and differs only from it in writing, i.e. if Tajik uses Cyrillic as writing, Dari uses his own script, which is slightly different from Arab Persian writing.
Dari, Persian and Tajik speakers understand each other without problem.
Origin of name
There are different versions of the origin of the name "Dari".
Most scientists believe that the word is related to the Persian word Darbar, the court, because the gift was spoken in the court of Sasanidas.
This view is based on medieval sources and works of early Islamic historians.[5] It should be made clear that the word "gift" in the early Middle Ages meant "public administration, office", therefore "dari", as the adjective derived from "gift" means "the language of administrative office", that is, "official language" and "public language".
In the modern Persian language, these concepts are translated into the Arabic words, which simply did not exist in the pre-Islamic Persian language.
Eyes
The vocalism of the literary gift is represented by eight vowels.
Although traditionally they differ on the basis of longitude-shortness, it is a fact that it has been marginalized, and all vowels, first, are qualitatively different (in terms of rise), and secondly, vowel / / o/ is more sustainable and vowel /e o/ is unstable.

Ivolginsk (bour.
Ebilge, the Evalga, was a village in 1973–1991, the capital of the Ivolgin district of the Republic of Buryatia, and the village of Ivolgin.
It has a population of 7382[1] (2010).
Ivolginsk.
Holy Mount Bayan Togod
The village is located in the centre of the Ivolgin Valley, 27 km south-west of Ulan Ude, and in the Kahtin tract, the A340-valued highway.
It's on the south side of the valley.
Locality is a steppe plain with a low slope to the Ivolghi River.
On the southern outskirts of the village is Mount Bayan Togod (710 m), which rises above the entire valley.
History
In the valley of Ivolgin, various Mongol tribes roamed.
In the early 18th century, she was settled by some of the ehilites and blags who had moved from the western side of Baikal.
Legends say that by acquiring a new homeland, they called it Ebilgate (the benevolent), which has evolved over time, largely under the influence of Russian documents, into Ebilgae, Ivalga, Ivolga.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Ivolginska was the site of the Mangazai and Boro-Gubee Buryats.
In 1940, the Uluz Mangazai was renamed Ivolginsk because of the relocation of the administrative centre of the Ivolgin district from the village of Sayantui.

History
The Buddhist tradition in the USSR was completely destroyed in the 1930s.
At the end of the Great Patriotic War, temples, churches, mosques, and Danes began to open in the country.
By Resolution No. 186 of 2 May 1945 of the Council of People's Commissioners of Buryat-Mongol ASSR on the opening of the Buddhist temple, the Hambian Sume, in the Ulus of Middle Ivolga, the construction of a new Dazan was authorized.
The Buddhist community began collecting money and religious utensils.
A wooden house was placed in the Oshor Bulag valley in the Ivolgin Valley with a view to becoming an arcane.
The believers began to take an active part in the construction work when they learned of the discovery.
On 12 December 1945, the first open service of the Sahusan Hural was held under the leadership of Gabshi Galsan Hydub.
In February 1946, the New Year's Service, Sagaalganai Hural, was run by all religious canons.
==History==The first Tsogchen dugan was built in 1948, with the construction of the second Tsogchen, which became the Choira-Dougan of the Faculty of Philosophy.
In 1951, the authorities officially allocated land to the monastery complex.
Llam houses, household buildings and office buildings were built.
In the 1970s, most dazana temples were built.
In 1970, the second eight-wall Tsogchen Dougan was built, with the construction of the third (modern) Cathedral in 1976, transformed into Devajin Soumé.
In 1991, Dashi Choinhorlin Damba Darja Zayaev, a Buddhist university, was established under Datsan, where approximately 100 Huwarak students are currently studying in four faculties: philosophy, tantric, iconographic and medical.
In the autumn of 2002, the Ivolgin Dane found the body of Humbo Lama Itigelov.
In January 2003, it was decided that the Temple Palace should be built to preserve the sacred relic.
==History==The temple was built on a project by the unguarded Devajin-Dougan of the Yangazhin dazan, designed and built by Itigalov himself in 1906. On 31 October 2008, the sanctification of the Blessed Hambo Lama Itigelov Palace was held.
The teacher's uninhabited body was solemnly transferred to the temple.
Dazana is currently host to hural services dedicated to the most important events of Buddhist history, daily rituals in honour of the defenders and guardians of the teaching, the Sahyusans, and other ceremonies that help and protect believers from various negative forces.
Dazan has been visited by many pilgrims and tourists from different countries.

The Soyota (sodod, soyyit, Sayats) is an indigenous small people living in the Okinsk region of the Republic of Buryatia (Russian Federation).
Number of soyots in populated areas (2002)
40 – 614 Orlik – 569 Hughir village – 314 Ulan Udeh – 191 Ulus Hurga – 159 Bockson village – 139 Ulysses Aleg Shulun – 134
Soyots are descendants of Sayan Samadis, who were part of the oldest population in Eastern Sayan, who remain within the limits of their first country.
Since then, the country has been jurized, covering primarily the language and only partially affecting the economy, the material culture and the world-view system.
The first written sources about the Soyot tribes are from the 17th century, and these are Russian command books of the Tales of the Cossacks and the people who served.
With the settlement of the Eastern Sayan, the Buryats of the Hongodor tribe, soyots married the burrowers, and there was a second change of language, a drilling of the tongue, but in the economic life of the Soyots they preserved the traditional way — they remained reindeer herders and hunters.
By then, they had already been recorded in the census as being drilled, although they had preserved their culture and ethnic identity.
Only the 2002 All-Russian Population Census took into account the soyots of a separate people.
Language
The soyots were originally spoken in a language that belonged to the Samdian group of the Ural language family, and subsequently the soyots were turquologized and transferred to the Soyot-Taatian language (near Tuvin), which is still a certain number of members, and which is also common in Mongolia in the Tsaatan version.
The soyots were later completely assimited with the drills, moving into the Burundian language of the Mongolian group of the Altai language family.
According to the 2002 All-Russian Census, 2,623 persons (96%) of the 2,739 soyots were in command of the Buryat language and 2,429 also in Russian (89%).[4]
In order to revive the Soyot language in 2001, for the first time, a script based on the Cyrillic language was developed for him (Sioyota version of the Soyot-Taatian language), and a letter and teaching aids were published.
In 2003, the "Soyot-Buriat-Russian dictionary" was published.
Since 2005, the progressive introduction of language teaching in the primary classes of the Sioot schools of the Okin District of Buryatia has begun.
Traditional activities
The main practice of soyots for centuries, as it is now, is nomadic reindeer herding and Yacoding.[6]
Hunting remains as an auxiliary fishing activity.
Society
The traditional social organization is based on the uniting of several births, led by a council of traditional elders.
The babies are known to be irritating, haasuut, and on top of it.
The National Soyot Festival of Jogtaar (meeting), which was renamed the Ulug-Dag (Great Mountain in honour of Mount Burin-han) in 2004, was revived.
Since 2008, Samaevian readings — a series of events dedicated to the protection of the cultural heritage of small peoples — have also been held on holiday.

The Paleo-Asian peoples (also Paleoasiate, ancient Asian peoples) are now an outdated ethnographic term (as a hypothesis) issued by the Russian ethnographer L. I. Shrenk in the mid-19th century to refer to a number of small northern peoples (Chukchi, Koryaki, Ainu, etc.) living in northern and north-eastern Siberia, as well as the Curil and Japanese islands.
The problem of the Paleo-Asian peoples
The reason for such grouping was the absence of obvious genetic links between their languages and the large linguistic families of North Asia.
The Paleo-Paleo is an archaic type of culture common to these peoples (see Paleolithic and Neolite).
A follow-up study (linguistic, ethnography and archaeological) has shown that all peoples originally classified as "Paleo-Asian" cannot be considered as a single ethnic group, although they are direct heirs to the ancient inhabitants of the North Asian region.
Only Italians, measless and Chukchi have a community of origin based on language and culture, and a more limited term of the North-East Palaeoasiate is used for this group.
List of nationalities
The following small peoples were included in this hypothetical group[1]: Chukchi, Koryak, Htelmen, Yucagirs, Duans, Nivhi, Keta and Ainu.

On the river are the villages of Kureti and Huray Nour, the capture of Yalga-Uzur and the district centre, the village of Yelans.
Water register data
According to the data of the Russian State Water Register and the geographic information system for water zoning of the territory of the Russian Federation, prepared by the Federal Agency for Water Resources:[4]
The basin district — Angaro-Bajkal River Basin — basins of small and medium tributaries in the middle and north of Lake Baikal River Podsin — does not have a water section — basins of rivers in the middle and north of Lake Baikal from the eastern boundary of the Angara River basin to the north-west boundary of the Barguzin River Basin

The Decrét (lat. decrete) is a legal act, a decision of an authority or official.
In simple terms, the decree often refers to maternity leave (elipsis from the outdated notion of "description leave").
This is not a terminological meaning.
In ancient Rome, the decree referred to acts of a collegiate authority, in particular the Senate and the decisions of the presiding judge in court cases.
That was the name of the emperor's acts during the imperial period.
Following the October Revolution, several legislative acts of the Councils, the WCTC and the SNC of the RSFSR were named by decree in Russia, other Soviet republics and the USSR.
Known decrees: Land Decree, Peace Decree, Dry Law Decree, Court Decrees, 8 Hours of Work Decree, Maternity Benefit Decree, Decree on the separation of the Church from the State and the School from the Church, Decree on the destruction of the Cosmiums and Civil Servants, Decree on the introduction of new legislation, the surrender of weapons, the Decree on Archives of 1 June 1918.
The Constitution of the USSR of 1924 granted the right to issue decrees to the CEC of the USSR, the Presidency of the CEC of the USSR and the SNC of the USSR.
The Constitution of the USSR of 1936 did not provide for the publication of legislation called decrees.
In some countries of Eastern Europe, the so-called People &apos; s Democracy Decrees were referred to as the legal acts of the highest public authorities.
In particular, the Polish People &apos; s Republic referred to acts of the Council of State as decrees.
Decrees (with decrees, orders and directives) are currently being issued by the President of Belarus.[1]
In many countries, the decree is a legal act that amounts to a law issued by the Head of State or Government without parliamentary approval.
The decree, as an act of the head of State, is provided for in the constitutions of a number of African States, where the French legal system has been accepted.
Such a decree could replace the law.
Many constitutions allow for decrees in certain situations (e.g. states of emergency).

Benzielpenicillin (PCN G) or simply penicillin (PCN) is a 6-aminopenicillanic acid called N-phenylaemiacylylacide, an antibiotic derived from a mold mushroom penicillium (Penicillium genus lat.
In the course of life, these mushrooms synthesize various forms of penicillin: one of the most active pharmacologically, benzilpenicillin and other types of penicillin, which differ from the first one, which contains other radicals instead of the benzil group.
Thus, the molecular structure of the penicillin is the acid from which various salts are derived (nathria, potassium, novocaine, etc.).[1]
The family of penicillin antibiotics includes benzilpenicillin (penicillin G), phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) and others.[2][3]
Penicillin antibiotics are of great historical importance because they are the first effective drugs against many serious diseases and, in particular, syphilis, as well as infections caused by staphylococcs and streptococts.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is an international legal instrument defining the rights of children in States parties.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the first and main binding international legal instrument dedicated to a wide range of children &apos; s rights.
The document consists of 54 articles detailing the individual rights of persons from birth to 18 years of age (unless under applicable law majority is attained earlier) to fully develop their capacities in conditions free from hunger and want, cruelty, exploitation and other forms of abuse.The Convention on the Rights of the Child is signed by the Holy See, Palestine and all UN Member States except the United States.[1]
One of the first steps of the UN General Assembly to protect children's rights was the education of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in 1946.
Two years later, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948.
Its provisions and those of the 1966 International Covenants relating to human rights recognize that children are subject to special protection.
But the first United Nations act on children's rights was the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, adopted by the General Assembly in 1959, which set out 10 principles for action by all those responsible for the full realization of children's rights, with the aim of ensuring them a "happy childhood".
The Declaration declared that "humanity has the duty to give the child the best that it has" to guarantee children the enjoyment of all rights and freedoms for their benefit and that of society.

Scientific activities
Ilya Ilich Mečnikov (3 [15] May 1845, Ivanovka, Kupian County, Kharkiv District — 2 [15] July 1916 in Paris) was a French and Russian biologist (microbiologist, cytologist, embryoologist, immunologist, physiologist and pathologist).
Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology and Medicine (1908).
One of the founders of evolutionary embryoology, the pioneer of pagocytosis and intracellular digestion, the creator of comparative inflammation pathology, the pagocitic theory of immunity, the theory of pagocytella, the founder of scientific gerontology.
==Early life==Ilya Ilyich Mečnikov was born in the father's estate of Ivanovk, Kupyan County of Kharkiv District, in the family of the guard officer, Ilya Ivanovich Mečnikov (1810–1878) and Emilia Lvovna Szeknikova (in the maidenhood of Nevakhović, 1814–1879).[4]
The parents were introduced by the brother of Emilia Lvovna, a colleague of Ilya Ivanovich.[5]
He is a student of the University of Kharkiv (1860-1864).
On the father's line, Ilya Ilyich Swordnikov came from an antiquated Moldovan genus.
Mother is Emilia Lvovna Nevakhović, a native of Warsaw, daughter of a famous Jewish publicist and educator Lion Nikolaevich Nevakhović (1776-1831), who is considered the founder of the so-called Russian-Jewish literature (especially his book "The Shout of the Journey of Judah", SPb, 1803).[6][7]
The brothers Emilia Nevakhović: Michael Lvovich Nevakhović (1817–1850) was a cartoonist who published the first Russian humourist collection "Eralash" (SPB, 1846–1849) and Alexander Lvovich Nevakhović (?–1880), who was the director of the repertoire part of the Imperial Theatres in 1837–1856.
Elijah Ivanovich Sechnikov was friends with both brothers of his wife.
The older brother, I. I. Sechnikova, is Lev Ilich Szeknikov, a Swiss geographer and socialist, an anarchist and member of the national liberation movement in Italy (risorgimento).
Another older brother, Ivan Ilyich Mečnikov (1836-1881), served as the prosecutor of the Tula District Court, President of the Kiev Trial Chamber, and became the prototype of the hero to lead L. N. Tolstoy "Death of Ivan Iljić" (1886).[8]
Lev Tolstoy and Ilya Swordnikov
Ilya Ivanovich Sechnikov was forced to leave St. Petersburg to settle in his own estate in Ivanovka, where his son Nikolai was born in 1843, and two years later Ilya.
Shortly after I was born, the family moved to a larger house at the other end of the father's estate in Panasowka (the same as the Kupyan county), where the future scientist spent his childhood years.
Nikolai Sechnikov became a secretary of the Republic, and was placed under strict police supervision at Kharkiv University for participating in student riots from 1868 to 1869.[10]
In addition to four sons, Catherine's daughter was raised in the family.
The niece of I. I. Sechnikov (sister's daughter) is an opera singer, Maria Kuznetsova.
Elijah Ilić married twice and tried to leave his life twice.
In 1869, he married Ludmila Fedorovich in Petersburg.
The bride was so weak because of tuberculosis that she was taken to the church where the wedding took place on a chair.
Swordsmen were hoping to cure their loved ones.
But four years later, Ludmila Vasilyevna died of tuberculosis in Madeira.
In the despair of the Swordmen, he drank a huge morphine.
Luckily, the morphine dose was too large, and it threw up.
The second time, Swordnikov married a 17-year-old student, Olga Belochova, in Odessa at the age of 30.
Once again, the suicide attempt caused by the wife's illness, Olga, was infected with typhoid typhoid.
Swordsmen have been injected with the bacteria of the return typhoid.
But when he got sick, he recovered.
Olga's wife too.
From 1856 to 1862, from the second grade, he studied at the 2nd Kharkiv men's gymnasium (he graduated from the gold medal).[13]
At that time, he lived with his brother Nikolai in the private boarding house of C. I. Schulza in the house No. 1 in the street of Christmas (1856-1858) and in the second floor of the house of the title counsellor, G. K. Groddikov, on the street of Blagovernez, 14 (1858-1864).[14][15]
Graduated from Kharkiv University (1864).
In Germany, a new class of invertebrates has been opened.
Thanks to N. I. Pirogova, he specialized in Germany with R. Laycard and C. Zibold, and studied the embryoology of invertebrate animals in Italy, where he met A. O. Kovalevsky.
In 1865, he discovered the phenomenon of intracellular digestion.
Embryology has proven the unity of origin of vertebrates and invertebrates.
He became an associate professor at the University of Novores Russia.
In 1867 he defended a master's thesis at the University of Petersburg, and from 1868 he was a private professor at the University.
I. M. Sechenov was recommended for the post of professor of the Military Medical Academy, but was spoiled and joined with retired protestors I. M. Sechenov, A. O. Kovalevski, and N. A. Umov at the University of Novo Russia in Odessa.
Lived at 36 on Hersonsky Street (now Pasteur).[16]
In 1873, his wife, Ludmila Vasilievna Feodorovitch, died of tuberculosis, which was prone to suicide, and the hopeless Swordnikov tried to commit suicide, but then decided to devote her life to the fight against tuberculosis.
In 1875, he married Olga Nikolaevna Belochovna (1858–1944), who became his assistant, and discovered an important function of intracellular digestion — fagocitic (cellular) immunity.
In 1879 he proposed a biological method to protect plants from pests.[17]
Odessa, Lion of Tolstoy, D. 4
After resigning in protest against the reactionary educational policy of the royal government and right-wing profession, he organized a private laboratory in Odessa, then (1886, in conjunction with N. F. Gamalei), the second-largest Russian bacteriological station for the control of infectious diseases (the building was retained, Lions Tolstoy Street, 4).
In 1887 he left Russia and moved to Paris, where he was provided with a laboratory at the Louis Pasteur Institute.
From 1905, he was Deputy Director of the Institute.
While living for the rest of his life in Paris, Swordnikov did not make contact with Russia.
In 1911, he led the Paster Institute's expedition to the core of the plague in Russia, making important observations not only about the plague but also about tuberculosis.[18]
He was systematically e-mailed with K. A. Timirazev, who involved him in the anti-war magazine Letopsi, I. M. Sečanov, I. P. Pavlov, N. A. Umov, D. I. Mendelev, etc.
He died in Paris on July 15, 1916, at the age of 71, after several myocardial heart attacks.
Ilya Swordnikov bequeathed his body for medical research, followed by cremation and burial on the grounds of the Pasteur Institute, which was carried out.
I. I. Swordsmen and Louis Pasteur
The scientific works of Szechnikov are part of a number of fields of biology and medicine.
In 1879, he discovered the mycose agents.[19]
In 1866–1886 he developed questions of comparative and evolutionary embryoology, being one of the founders of this field, together with Alexander Kovalevsky.
Proposed the original theory of origin of multicellular animals (see Fagocytela theory).
In 1882 he discovered the phenomena of fagocytosis (as reported in 1883 at the 7th Congress of Russian natural scientists and doctors in Odessa) and developed a comparative pathology of inflammation (1892) and subsequently a pagocitic theory of immunity (inviolability in infectious diseases - 1901; Nobel Prize - 1908, in conjunction with P. Erlich).
Swordsmen &apos; s numerous works in bacteriaology focus on cholera, typhoid, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases, with E. Ru for the first time causing experimental syphilis in monkeys (1903).
Swordnikov's work focused heavily on ageing, and he believed that man's old age and death were premature as a result of microbial and other poisons.
Intestinal flora was the most important Swords in this respect.
On the basis of these submissions, the Swordnikov has proposed a number of preventive and sanitary measures to combat self-immolation (sterilization of food, restriction of meat consumption, etc.).
Memorial to the Swordnikovu in front of the Pasteur Institute in Kharkov
The main tool in the fight against aging and self-infestation of the Swordnikov human body was the Bulgarian milkworker's wand, Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus.
He was the first in the world to appreciate the importance of opening up a Bulgarian student, Stamen Grigorov.
Back in 1905, as director of the Pasteur Institute, he invited a young Bulgarian to Paris to give a lecture about his discovery of microbiology in front of the luminaries of the time.
The results of the world's first medical study of the functional properties of the Bulgarian wand and the Bulgarian acid milk were published in 1907:
A portrait in youth
Swordsmen have personally repeated Grigorov's research to make sure they're viable.
In 1908, on the anniversary of the French Academy of Sciences, he published an article on acid milk.[20]
After studying ageing issues and collecting data from 36 countries, the Swordnikov found that the largest number of "stoats" in Bulgaria was 4 per 1,000 people; it was linked to Bulgarian yogurt (in Bulgaria it is called mlaco kiselo "acid milk").
For the rest of his life, he himself regularly used not only milky acid but also a clean culture of the Bulgarian wand.
The ultimate goal of combating the premature ageing of the Swords was to achieve "a full and happy cycle of life ending in a peaceful natural death".[21][22]
In a number of works, Swordnikov has addressed many of theoretical and philosophical issues, and in early writings on Darwinism (An account of the origin of species, 1876, etc.), Swordnikov has put forward a number of ideas that pre-empt a modern understanding of some of the issues of evolution.
Andalusia[1] is a Spanish autonomous community composed of eight provinces: Almeria, Kadisa, Cordova, Granada, Huelva, Haena, Malaga and Seville.
Her capital is Seville.
Andalusia is located at the southwest end of Europe and is washed in the south by the Strait of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean Sea, and in the west by the Atlantic Ocean and is bordered by Portugal.
Inside Spain, in the north of Andalusia, it is bordered by Estremadura and Castilla La Manche, and in the east by Murcia.
River Guadalquivir, Cordova
Language
Andalusia speaks mainly the Andalus dialect of Spanish, which emerged after the Castilian conquest of Muslim Andalusia.
This linguistic modification, enriched by the strong influence of the Arab substrate and the local Romany (Beta Mosarabian) language, as well as by its own evolution in the first centuries of its existence, has had the greatest impact on the dialects and linguistic variations of Spanish in America.

Shepherd and sheep
The image of sheep in culture
The domestic sheep (lat. Ovis aries) is a species of mammal in the genus sheep family.
This animal was already in deep ancient times domesticated by a man, mainly because of its thick wool and edible meat.
At present, the hair of a sheep, or runo, is used more frequently than that of any other animal.
Sheep meat, known as ovine meat, is one of the most important consumer products in many parts of the world.
In addition to wool and meat, sheep are also produced to produce sheep milk, birch, cooking fat, and skins (sheeps).
Finally, sheep are used in scientific experiments, the most famous member of this species being Dolly, the world's first cloned mammal in 1996.
Herding — the herding industry — is practised worldwide and has always played an important role in the economies of many countries.
Currently, the largest numbers of sheep are found in China (about 144 million heads), Australia (98 million), India (over 60 million), Iran (54 million), New Zealand (44 million), Great Britain (36 million), South Africa (up to 29 million), Turkey (27 million), Pakistan and Spain (24 million each).
In post-Council countries, sheep farming is most important as the livestock industry in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Moldova and southern Russia.
The sheep was domesticated by a man in a deep old age, more than 8,000 years ago in modern Turkey, Syria, northern Mesopotamia.[3]
The sheep were thought to be descendants of a muflon or urial.
Cytogenic analysis suggests that the ancestor of the domestic sheep was a muflon.
The urial cariotype contains 58 chromosomes, while the number of chromosomes is 54 for domestic sheep and muflon.
The pound (from lat. pondus () is a unit of mass measurement.
It has historically been used in some European countries, and in the era of feudal fragmentation in some countries (e.g. France), its importance was the right to install each pheodle, so even in the early 18th century there were more than 100 different pounds in Europe.[2]
This pound was called a Russian pound of trade weight.
There was also a pharmacist or Nürnberg pound (unit for measuring pharmacist weight).
According to the Commercial Regulations, 1893, 1 pharmacist pound = 7/8, or 0.875 Russian pounds.
1 Russian pound = 32 lotes = 96 gold pieces = 9,216 shares = 1/40 poodles; 1 pharmacist pound = 12 ounces = 96 drachmas = 288 scrupulses = 5,760 pharmacists.
Relationship to the metric system[6]:
1 g = 0.2342557 gold pieces; 1 g = 22.504855 shares; 1 kg = 2.441933 pounds; 1 kg = 2 pounds 42 gold pieces 40.855 shares; 1 quintile (centner) = 6 poods 4.1933 pounds; 1 t = 61 pood 1.933 pounds.
Milligrams, grams and kilograms in pharmacist weight:
1 mg = 0.016075 Gran; 1 g = 16.08 Gran; 1 kg = 2 pounds 9 ounces 4 drachmas; 1 pharmacist gran = 62.2088 mg; 1 drachma = 3.73.2527 g; 1 ounce = 29.860215 g; 1 pound pharmacist = 0.358322 kg.
Other pounds
In English-speaking countries
The Austrian pound is equal to 0.56001 kg (also used in Bavaria) the Amsterdam pound is 0.4941 kg the Venice pound is equal to 0.477 kg the Danish pound is equal to 0.496 kg the Ancient pound (libra) is equal to 0.32745 kg the Spanish pound is equal to 0.451 kg the Karoling pound is equal to 0.408 kg[8] the Portuguese pound is equal to 0.459 kg the Russian artillery pound is equal to 0.4914 kg the French pound (libr) is equal to 0.489505 kg the Swedish pound is equal to 0.425076 kg the Livonian/Hanzey pound[9] is equal to 0.4847 kg (in Livonia the predominantly Baltic Ganzei system of measures based on the measures of Ljubek and Hamburg) the Nürnberg pound is equal to 0.5095 kg (as commercially distributed in mid-Germany and used as an artillery pound in central Europe) the Prussian system of measures based on the measures of Lübeck and Hamburg is equal to 0.5995 kg (as commercially distributed in mid-Germany and as far as an artillery in central Europe) the entire region of the Rhine region the German region is equal to 2.511 kpt in the German region the German kppt is equal to 0.45
Many European countries using the metric system use the so-called "metric pound" (Nm. Pfund, Fr. livre, Niderl. pund) at exactly 0.5 kg.

There were several pounds (troy, London, tower, etc.).
Now the English pound corresponds to:
16 ounces = 7,000 grams; (metric system) = 0.45359237 kg.
Currently, the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) in its recommendations assigns a pound to those units of mass measurement "which should be retired as soon as possible where they are currently used and which should not be introduced if they are not used".[4]
In the Russian system of measures
In the Russian system of measures, the pound is equal to 96 gold pieces and has been the reference weight since 1747.
In 1747, a "bronze gold pound of 1747" was produced, for which a platinum pound was produced in 1835, the basis for weight measures in the Russian Empire and Soviet Russia until the decree "On the introduction of an international metric system of measures and weights", signed by V. I. Lenin in 1918.

Notes
Udmurt language is divided into five dialects:[7]
The northern dialect (in the north of Udmurtia, as well as in the Kirov region, the dialect centre is the city of Glasov); the Bermian dialect; the central dialect (including Izhevsk); the southern dialect; and the eight sub-dialects located in Bashkortostan and Tatarstan form a peripheral dialect.
All dialects differ slightly, mainly in the area of the music; they are mutually reinforcing.
Use of language in the media
Udmurtia GTRC, My Udmurtia Radio Company, Oshmes, Light Trek, Udmurt Dunne, district newspapers.
In the movies.
The bonds of Bora (film), Puzcar (film), Alangasara's Shadow, and the Companions.
The language belongs to the Perm branch of the Finnish-Hungarian languages of the Ural family.
The Udmurt language differs from the other perm languages by hitting the last syllable, by some of the morphology of the verb, by two forms of tension.
There are relatively many Tatar and Russian borrowings in cultural language.
In the Udmurt language, there is no distinction between vowels in length, nor is there a synnarmonism of vowels.
According to /f/ and /t\s/ are only found in borrowings and have traditionally been replaced /p/ and /t10/, respectively.

Model inscription in Udmurt
Almost all Udmurt speakers are bilingual: according to the 2010 census, 552,299 people indicated that they were Udmurts, 58.7% of whom referred to Udmurt as their mother tongue.
Udmurtsky-Russian bilingualism accounts for 64.4 per cent, or 92.8 per cent of the total number of speakers; there are also cases of Udmurt-Tatar bilingualism and even Udmurt-Tatar-Russian trilingualism, which totals 68.5 per cent of Russians.[3]
In the 2010 census, 324,000 people indicated that they speak Udmurt language.[4]
The Udmurt language is recognized as one of the State languages of the Udmurt Republic.
The Udmurt language is taught in schools of the Republic.[5]
It produces books, including original and translated art literature, television and radio broadcasts, and newspapers and magazines.
However, according to [Winkler, 6], a television broadcast in Udmurt is available only once a week and lasts 30 minutes.
The gubernaator (through Polish gubernator from lat. gubernator from other Greeks) is the head of a large territorial, federal unit.
In Russia, until 1917, the governor was the highest government official in the province.
The name of the senior official of a Federation entity is determined by its own legislation and, therefore, the "governors" are always named as heads of regions and cruises. In the national republics, governors are drawn from the Presidents (e.g. Tatarstan) and the heads of republics (e.g. Chechnya, Mordonia).
In some regions, the name "head of state administration" is also used, etc.
In some modern states (United Kingdom, Denmark, USA, etc.), the Governor is a senior official of a territorial or federal unit appointed by the central authorities or elected by the population.
Domain, lata, regio, or superstarism, is the highest level (rang) of the species group in the system, including one or more kingdoms.
Notes
The philogenetic tree, based on RRNA analysis, shows the separation of bacteria, arches and eukaryots
The term was proposed in 1990 by Carl Woeza, who divided all living organisms into three domains:
Archaeaea; bacteria (Bacteria) or eubacteria; eukaryota.
The most radical difference from previous systems was that bacteria (procariots) were divided into two taxa (archaea and eubacteria), each of which had the same rank as eukariats.
Sometimes these three domains, as well as viruses (a group without rank), are combined into the Biota taxon,[1] whose rank is sometimes defined as an "overdoman".
In addition to the widely recognized Vöze system, there are alternative systems of higher-level groups (Ranga), such as:
The system in which living organisms are divided into two empires (or super-kings): Eukaryota (Eukaryota) and Prokaryota (Prokaryota), and the latter correspond to the archaea and eubacteria of the Woze system.
A system of five kingdoms (ungrouped): Prokaryota (or Monera), protists (Protista), mushrooms (Fungi), plants (Plantae) and animals (Animalia), with the last four kingdoms corresponding to the Eukariot empire (domen).

Taxonomic principles are applied in many scientific fields of knowledge, to rationalize objects of geography, geology, linguistics, ethnography and the diversity of the organic world.[2]
The term "taxonomy" was first proposed in 1813 by Augustin Decandole, who was involved in the classification of plants, and was originally used only in biology.
The term was later used to refer to the general theory of classification and systematization of complex systems in both biology and other fields of knowledge, linguistics, geography, geology.[2]

History
On 2 March 1956, the North-East Department of the Institute of Merszlotology was established and its specialists were instructed to investigate the possibility of erecting Leninou's monument on eternal soil, which, because of its heavy workload, had not been previously installed in these conditions.
On October 6, 1957, the monument was laid, first of all a massive posturing, which was tested for several years and monitored the perpendicular of its walls.
It was later subjected to bronze sculpture and for several years to seasonally control the vertical location of the structure, making it more difficult to balance the pedestal and the monument with the arm of the bronze Lenin to the sky, while initially the sculptors took account of this factor by pushing the left foot of the sculpture forward.
The memorial was inaugurated on 25 October 1967, at the 100th anniversary of V. I. Lenin.
Authors of the monument: Sculptor - Strucchikki Y. D.; architects: Milovidov N. N., Ozhev S. S., who was awarded the rank of honored artist of the Yakut SSR.[1]
Description
The Great Tintin Eleanor Hernman Toungberg (Swed.
Greta Tintin Eleanora Hernman Thunberg; born January 3, 2003(2003-01-03)[1], Stockholm[1] is a Swedish schoolgirl and environmental activist.
At the age of 15, she began to protest near the Swedish Parliament with the poster "school strike for climate", calling for urgent action to combat climate change in accordance with the Paris Agreement.
Its actions have been resonated around the world, creating mass events known as "school strikes for the climate" or "Fridays for the future".[6][7][8]
Greta launched a movement of students concerned about climate change, the idea of which is that on Fridays, instead of class, schoolchildren go to the streets in an effort to draw the attention of politicians and the public to the climate crisis.
In her interventions, she refers to the 2018 IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C[en][21][22]. According to Tunberg,[3]:
In December 2018 and May 2019, Greta met with the United Nations genec Antonio Guterrish, who approved the strikes, saying: "My generation failed to respond adequately to the serious problem of climate change.
In January 2019, Tunberg visited the Davos Forum, where she took the train, leaving too much carbon footprint.[26] She called for decisive action by politicians and businessmen.[27]
On 21 February 2019, she addressed a conference of the European Economic and Social Committee.[28]
Tongberg at the Fridays for the Future meeting in Berlin.
July 2019
In April 2019, in a meeting with representatives of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, she criticized those present "for three urgent summits because of the brace and zero urgent summits due to the destruction of the climate and the environment".
After the end of her speech, the hall began with a long applause.
Also in April 2019, Greta met with Pope Francis during a general audience in the Vatican.
Greta thanked Dad for his advocacy for the environment.
Francis replied: "God bless you.
Keep doing what you're doing.
In May 2019, Greta met with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of Austria at a conference organized by Schwarzenegger to accelerate the implementation of the Paris Agreement.[33]
Biography
On 23 September 2019, in New York, at the United Nations Climate Summit, Tunberg delivered an emotional four-minute speech accusing world governments of empty talk and neglect of climate problems, as well as of betraying young people and future generations.[34][35]
According to Tunberg, the climate impact of emissions has been scientifically clear for thirty years, but world leaders, while saying that they are doing everything they can, are in fact turning a blind eye to the problem, being not mature enough to say "it's what it is".[36]
In March 2019, two Swedish Riksdag deputies from the opposition Left Party (Jens Holm[sv] and Hokan Svenneling[sv][37][38]) and three Norwegian Storting deputies from the opposition Socialist Left Party (Freddie André Owstagord[no], Mona Fageros[no] and Lars Haltbrekken[n] [39]) nominated Greta Tunberg for the Nobel Peace Prize[40] [41].
They argued that global warming will cause wars, conflicts and refugees if we do nothing about it.[42]
It was declared a woman of the year in Sweden[en] in 2019[43]
Greta Tunberg is outside the Swedish Parliament with a poster entitled "school strike for climate".

Evaluations
The world's attitude towards Greta Tunberg extends from critical speech and ridicule to respect and admiration.[1]
In Russia
On October 10, 2019, WLCOM conducted a survey on Russian attitudes towards Grete Tunberg.
Her name is known to 37% of the adult interviewees.
Of these, 40 per cent are "faster positive", 27 per cent "shorter negative" and 31 per cent "negative".
Greta was born on 3 January 2003 in Stockholm.
Her mother, Malena Ernman, is a Swedish opera singer and father, actor Swante Tunberg.
According to Greta herself, she first heard about climate change at the age of 8, but could not understand why no one was trying to do anything about it.[9]
At the age of 11, Tunberg became depressed and stopped eating and talking.
She was found to have asperger syndrome (soft form of autism spectrum disorder)[10][11], obessive-compulsive disorder[12] [13] and selective mutism[11][14].
In Greta's view, selective mutism means that it only means "when it believes that it is essential and now it is one of these moments".[15]
Asperger Greta's syndrome regards itself as a "gift" that defines her vision of the world, unlike most, in a "very black and white color."
In May 2018, Greta Tunberg was one of the winners of a climate contest organized by the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.
Her article was published by the newspaper, after which she was contacted by activist Bo Thorén (Swed. Bo Thorén) of the environmental organization Fossilfritt Dalsland, who visited several of their meetings, and at one of them Thoren suggested that schoolchildren could start a strike against climate change.[16]
According to Tunberg, the idea was based on strikes by American schoolchildren scared of mass shootings in Florida schools.[17]
She tried to convince other young people to take part in the strike, but "no one was interested," so she decided to strike alone.[18]

The story of the epic
The tradition creates an epic era for the legendary era, calling Manas the first performer of the co-conspirator, Yurchi-woul son of Yuraman, who performed the feats of the hero at his funeral; and the song-weeping people had joined the legendary singer Toktogul in one epic (the Kirgis of the first half of the twentieth century believed that he had lived 500 years ago).
Other legends are also known, as are the names of many 19th - century manacs whose work was not recorded.[8]
Modern scientists did not agree on the timing of the epic, but some suggest that history tells more about the 15th to 16th century.
There were hypotheses that its foundation was linked to the events of the history of the Kirgis of the ninth century.
B. M. Girmunski felt that the historical background of the work was generally consistent with the conditions of the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, although it had more ancient concepts.[9]
E. M. Meletinsky points out that the epic times in Manas are not mythical (as opposed to many epic stories of the Tunisian peoples of Siberia) but historic[10]
The first references to the epic are to the 16th century, and they are contained in the semi-fantastic essay of Majmu al-Tawarich, where Manas is shown as a historical figure, acting with the actual Tokhtamish, the good-shammed Muhammad, etc.
Contents and narrative
After the death of the Kyrgyz Khan of Noga, the old enemies of the Kyrgyz Kidani, taking advantage of the indecisiveness of his successors, take over the lands of the Kyrgyz and drive them out of Ala Too.
The descendants of Noah are driven to a remote place.
The rest are caught under the brutal oppression of the invaders.
Noah's youngest son, Jacchip, is being banished to Altai, and for many years has had to serve the Altai Kalmaks.
He was able to make money by working in the gold mines.
At a mature age, Jacchip becomes the owner of countless livestock, but his soul is insulted by the fact that no heir has given his fate.
He grieves and prays for God's mercy, visits holy places, and sacrifices.
Finally, after a wonderful dream, his older wife conceived a child, nine months later she gave birth to a boy.
On the same day, Jacchipa's tabun came into being a child he was destined for his newborn son.

Manas (kirg.
Manas) is the largest Kyrgyz epic and the name of its main hero, the rich man who united the Kyrgyz.
"Manas" is included in the UNESCO list of masterpieces of the intangible cultural heritage of mankind, as well as in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest epic in the world.
Jacqueep on the joys throws a big feast and calls the boy Manas.
Since he was a child, he has displayed unusual qualities, and he is different from all his peers in his extraordinary physical strength, impropriety and generosity.
The glory of him goes far beyond Altai.
The Kalmaki who live on Altay are in a hurry to inform the Chinese Khan Esenkan that the defiant Kyrgyzs have a Batir who should be captured and destroyed while he is not yet married.
Esencan sends his lasarets to the kirgis, dressed as traders, and he's tasked with taking Manas into custody.
They catch a young rich man playing horde and try to grab him.
The thousands of troops of Kalmac rich Neskara are headed against the Kyrgyz.
By uniting all the neighbouring peoples and tribes, Manas opposes Neskara, and has a brilliant victory over his army.

Manas fights an unequal battle with the Uighurs and wins.
In this battle, he is greatly helped by the Khan of the Kyrgyz Katagans [12] Batir Koshay.
One of Uighur's defeated rulers, Kaiupdan, gives Manas her daughter Carabeurik, who herself expresses the desire to marry a Bater.
At Koshoi's suggestion, Manas decides to return to the people the homelands of Ala Too, captured by the Kyrgyz opponents.
When he gathers his army, he fights and wins.
The Kyrgyz decide to move from Altai to their ancestral lands.
Manas and his family are located near the sacred black mountains of Aziret.
The old enemy of the Kyrgyz is the Chinese Khan Alooke, decides to stop the expansion of the Kyrgyz and is beginning to prepare for the march.
When he learns of this, Manas goes on an urgent march with his 40 friends, he easily disperses the enemy's army and takes the bet of Khan Aloka.
Seeing the determination and courage of the rich man of Manas, Alooka decides to make peace with the Kyrgyz and, in recognition of his submission, gives Manas his son Bokoke.
At this time, the conflict between Kyrgyz and Afghan Khan Shorouq has intensified on the southern frontier, and Manas has gathered his troops to fight.
The defeated Afghan ruler has concluded a diplomatic marriage with the Kyrgyz, impersonating his daughter Akylai for Manas and sending with her forty female servants.
A separate plot branch of the epic tells the story of the rich diamondbeth.
It covers events from the moment he was born to his arrival at Manas.
The father of Almabeta Soronduk was one of the great Chinese regiments.
For a long time, he was childless, and when he reached adulthood, he finally found a son.
Almambet has been studying science since childhood, mastering the arts of magic and witchcraft, studying at the School of Dragon Teaching (in Kyrgyz, "Azydadardin Okusu") and teaching children from prominent families, but he is the best in teaching and later growing up as a brave warrior.
reason, honesty, courage make him famous.
At a young age, Almabeth succeeded his father by leading all the Chinese army.
One day, while hunting, he meets Khan Kökcho, who calls him to light and abandon witchcraft.
When he returned home, Almabeth urged his relatives to convert to the new faith.
Neither parents nor relatives even want to listen to Almabeth.
Soronduk orders the arrest of a son who refused "the faith of his ancestors".
Having escaped from the Chinese, Almabeth finds refuge with Kökchö.
The generosity, reason, and justice of the Almabeth reinforce his glory, but the jigit of the Khan Kökchö are passionate about his new ruler who is close to him, and they make false rumours about the proximity of Almabeth and his wife, Kökchio Akerchek.
Without any slander, Almabeth leaves Kökchö.
And the rich guy happens to meet Manas, who went hunting with his 40 jigits.
Manas has long heard of Almabeta and therefore meets him with honors, a feast for him.
Manas and Almambet become brothers.
Parts and storytellers
And since Manas married Akylai and Carabeurik to make peace, the rich man asks his father Jacchip to find a wife for him.
After a long search, Jacchip arrives at the Khan of Atemir in Buhar, where he looks after the daughter of Khan Sanirabiga.
Jacchip grabs her, pays her rich ransom, and Manas takes Sanirabiga's wife by all the rules.
The Kyrgyz call Manas' wife Kanykei, which means "married to the Khan".
Forty jigs of Manas marry 40 girls who came with Kanyka.
Almambet is marrying the daughter of the patron of wild mountain animals, Aruka.
Upon learning about Manas, relatives in exile far northward decide to return to him.
These are the children of Jacqueep's older brother Ussen, who have lived many years among a foreign people, who have taken their wives from the Kalmaks, and who have forgotten the customs and customs of their ancestors.
Among the Kalmaks, they were called Kozkamans.
At this time, Manas is forced to go to the Batru Koshoy to help.
The Afghan Khan Tulkyu, taking advantage of Koshoi's absence, raides the Katagan tribe and kills the son of a Kyrgyz rich man.
But Tulkyu's younger brother, Akun, decides to avoid bloodshed and settles the conflict between the Kyrgyz and the Afghans.
Tulkyu pleads guilty, pays a ransom for the murder of Koshoi's son, and gives way to his throne to Akuna.
Manas and Akun enter into a friendship agreement and agree that their children, if they have a boy and a girl, will be engaged.
In addition, Bokmurun, a son of the Kyrgyz Khan Kököy, who settled in Tashkent after Panus' expulsion, wishes to marry his daughter, Tülkay, named Kanyshai. On the advice of Manas, Bakai goes to Tulka and performs all the rites he has to perform.
In the absence of Manas, Közkamana arrives.
Kanyikei is happy to meet the husband's relatives, giving them what is normally necessary for the maintenance of the household.
Manas, who has returned from the camp, is hosting a feast in honor of his relatives.
It is He who gives them land and cattle and all kinds of things.
Despite such a welcome reception, the envious Koskamans conspire against Manas.
They decide to poison the Bater, take the throne, and take possession of all Manas' possessions.
Koskamans find the right time to lure a matron with his friend to visit.
When he returned from another camping trip, Manas was happy to accept the invitation.
Batrons and his friends get poison mixed up in their food.
The survivor, Manas, drinks off all his friends and goes back to the bet.
Koskamans are looking for those responsible for failure, and there's a fight between them, and they're all using knives and killing themselves.
The good Kyrgyz Khan Kököyöy, who has reached old age, is leaving white light.
Leaving his son Bokmurun a will with instructions on how to perform the burial and how to arrange all the post-mortem rites, he also makes a will to seek counsel from Manas.
By burying Kyuköy, Bokmurun is preparing for three years of trinity.
Manas takes over all the control of Kyukyoy's trinity.
Many visitors from the most distant countries arrive at the trinity.
Bokmurun offers rich prizes to winners of various competitions.
A number of Kyrgyz elders and Khans of individual generations have expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that Manas is the sole owner of the trinity.
They gather counsel and decide to make their demands public.
But the conspirators are subdued by old Kosha.
He encourages them not to fight with many guests, among them long-standing enemies of the Kyrgyz, and promises the conspirators to subdue Manas after the trinity.
A year later, the conspirators demanded that Koshoi head their embassy to Manas and help them to remove their superior ruler.
Kosha, referring to age, refuses to go after the conspirators.
Then they decide to send the racing racers to Manas to inform them that all the great heads of Kyrgyz descent are going to visit him as guests.
Their intention was to bring a large group to Manas to make him make any mistake in the ritual of hospitality, to fight and then to demand that the Khan be abandoned.
Manas agrees to receive the noble guests with all their large numbers.
The guests are welcomed by 40 friends and are placed on their own yurt and ailam.
Having seen such unity among the friends and having seen the tenacity of Manas' power, the Kyrgyz Khans realize that they are in an awkward situation.
No one decides to answer Manas' question about the purpose of their arrival.
Then Manas informs them that there has come to him the news of a march against the Kyrgyz people.
China's Han Konurbani, who has held the grudge for his previous defeats, gathers thousands of troops in order to once again subjugate the Kyrgyz.
Manas calls on the Kyrgyz Khans to warn the enemy and to go out on their own, united forces to defeat the enemy in its territory and stop any attempt to conquer the Kyrgyz.
The Khans are forced to accept Manas' offer.
The Khan of all the Kyrgyz during the great march is elected to Bakai, and Almambet is the main leader of the Kyrgyz army, leading them to the capital of the Chinese Beijin.
After a long and difficult journey, the Kyrgyz army has reached the borders of the Chinese State.
Leaving the army at the dock, Almambet, Sirgak, Chubak and Manas are on their way to reconnaissance.
When they enter the enemy's territory, they steal numerous taboos.
Chinese troops are going after the thieves.
There is a battle, and the Kyrgyz are able to break and disperse the many thousand enemy forces.
According to the Manas episus, with its troops (indies), it takes Beijing ("Bajeen" translation from Kyrgyz "the bad mare") and rules for six months.
The Chinese pay them tribute and declare their desire to make peace.
Manas has generously decided to spare Konurbay and the rest of the Chinese leaders.
But Conurbai couldn't accept defeat and kill the best Kyrgyz boots one by one, killed by Almambet, Chubak and Sirgak.
By secretly breaking into Manas' battle bet, Konurbani is inflicting a fatal wound on the rich man, punching him in the back with a spear, when an unarmed trampoline performed morning prayers on the Bagomdat.
Upon returning to his home country, Manas cannot recover from the wound and dies.
Kanykei's burying a rich man in a cumbass.
The tragic end of the first part of the trilogy reaches realistic credibility.
Manas' premortem will refers to tribal strife, weakening the power of the Kyrgyz people united by Manas.
The birth of the son of Manas — the Seed — already predisposes future vengeance for the loss of his father.
So there was a second, thought- and plot about the first part of the poem, dedicated to the life description and actions of the son of Manas Semeti and his companions, who repeat the heroism of their fathers and seek victory over foreign invaders.
The Manas image at the highest government award in Kyrgyzstan, the Manas Order.
Not forty days after the death of Manas, Jacchip begins to demand that Kanykei be married to one of Manas' half brothers.
His stepbrother, Kobesh, comes to Manas' place, harassing Kanykei and seeking to destroy the baby Semeti.
Kanykei is forced to flee with the baby to his relatives.
Semetei is growing up without knowing his origin.
After reaching the age of 16, he learns that he is the son of Manas and expresses his desire to return to his people.
He's going back to Talas, where his father's bet was.
The enemies of Manas, including the half brothers of Abeke and Kobesh, as well as those who betrayed him, are killed by the hand of Semeti.
Batyr will marry Aichurek, whom he was engaged to before he was born, according to Manas' promise.
He's raiding Chinese territory and fighting to kill Konurbay, taking revenge on him for his father's death.
The Seedea betrays Kanchoro, who conspired with the enemy of Kyash.
After having sustained a fatal injury from Kyash, Semetheus suddenly disappears.
His loyal companion Kulchoro is captured, and Aichurek becomes the prey of enemies.
Canchoro's traitor becomes a hank.
He's expecting the Semetheus baby, but no one knows.
The heroic poem "Semetey" is the most frequently performed trilogy cycle.
The courageous heroes of the poem are also the victims of injustice, but the perpetrators are not foreign invaders, but internal enemies.
The third part of Manas, Setech, is dedicated to the epic narrative of the struggle against internal enemies.
It speaks of the rich Seiteka, the grandson of Manas, and is a logical extension of the previous parts.
This part has the same conceptual basis for preserving the unity of the people, ridding themselves of external and internal enemies and achieving a peaceful life.
The plot of the Seitech epic is based on the following events: the upbringing of Seitek as enemies of his father who does not know his origin, the divorcing of Seitek and the discovery of his secret origin, the expulsion of his enemies and the return of Semeti to his people, the unification of the people and the advent of peaceful life.
The images of Semeti and Seitek reflect the people's desire to preserve the legends of Manas in the heroic lives of his descendants.

==History==In 1825, Madali Khan founded the Cockand Fortress of Pishpek, the largest garrison in the Chui Valley, on the territory of the modern city.
The fortress was at the centre of the nomads' paths from winter pastures to summer and along the road to Issik Kul and Semírije.
The first documentary reference to the settlement of Pishpek is made in the book "The Description of the War Activities in the Zailia Province in 1860 and the Journal of the Siege of the Kokand Fortress of Pishpek":[16]:
Twice (4 September 1860 and 24 October 1862), the fortress was taken by Russian forces.
In November 1862, the remains of the fortress were destroyed by the Solto Kyrgyz, and two years later a Cossack picket was installed, then the bazaar was assembled.
Since October 1924, it has become the administrative centre of Kara-Kyrgi Autonomous Region, and since May 1925, it has been the administrative centre of the Kyrgyz Autonomous Region.

Average annual temperature +11.3 °C. The precipitation falls 450 mm per year.
In 1868, the first peasant families from Penzena, Samara, Voronezh, and Tambov Province founded a Russian settlement, Pishpek, along the tractor road.
These first settlers were joined by Uzbek traders from Tashkent, Namangan and other areas of modern Uzbekistan.
By 1876, there were 58 families in Pishpek: 182 of them of both sexes, including 94 women (the Russian family was 9; the Uzbek family was 48; the Tatar family was 1).[17]
On 29 April 1878, in connection with the transfer to Pishpek of the centre of Pishpek County, the settlement was granted the status of a city (see Semireken region), which date is officially marked as the date on which the city was founded.[18]

According to the 1989 census, 13,619 Germans lived in Frunz.[9]
The population of Bishkek is characterized by a rapid increase in the number of migrants from other regions of the Republic, as well as a relatively high natural increase in the Kyrgyz population, and the proportion and absolute number of European peoples, which already accounted for over 80 per cent of the population of the city over the years of independence, has fallen sharply because of emigration and low fertility in these categories of the population.
National composition
In the population the population was spread out with 2019: in the year 1989,[12]% of the population, the population was 6.2% in 2009, and 6.1% in the year 2009, and 6.1% in the year 2009, and 6.2% in the year 2009, and 6.2% in the year 2009, 30% of the population was 6.1%.
History
The city is located in the north of Kyrgyzstan, in the Chuy Valley, at an altitude of 700–9000 metres above sea level, 40 kilometres north of the Kyrgyz Ridge near the Tian Shan hills.
25 km from the border with Kazakhstan.
Bishkek is connected to the Turkestano-Siberian Railway.
The city has 127 km2[5] or 160 km2[1].
On April 24, 1924, the Czechoslovak Intergelpo cooperative, which actually made a modern European city out of Pischpek, arrived in the city by the standards of the time.
On May 12, 1926, Pishpek was renamed Frunz after a native of the city, Soviet military commander Michael Frunze.
Since 1936, Frunze is the capital of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Kyrgyzstan.
It was founded in 1878 as a settlement on the site of the former Cockand Fortress of Pishpek, which was renamed Frunz in 1926 to commemorate the Soviet party and military figure M. V. Frunze.
However, since the Kyrgyz language did not contain the sound of "f" and there was no room for agreement at the beginning of the word, the local people had been called "Purunze".
After the collapse of the USSR and the independence of Kyrgyzstan, the question of the renaming of the capital arose.
The etymology of the original name "Pishpek" was found to be unknown; the Kyrgyz word "Bishkek" was the "moutoon" that was plagued by the cubes.
It is not clear how this property could be linked to the name of the fortress, but Bishkek was adopted as the new name of the capital in 1991.[6]

Aesthetics on the French map of 1685
Estes (lat. Aesti) is the name of the medieval population of modern Estonia.[1]
For the first time, an ethnic person is referred to by Tacit for a certain Baltic tribe.
Estes as a people of Finnish-Ugori origin (i.e. Estonians) are described for the first time in the 13th - century Libyan chronicles (in particular in the case of Henry of Latvia).
Their name, inherited from ancient Latin writers, was mistakenly understood by medieval writers as being derived from the term "east", "ost" (i.e. "East Land" - Eastland).
Modern Estonians have taken this book term to refer to their nation only since the nineteenth century (in the period of "national revival").
For the first time in Estonia, the new name eesti rahvas "people of Estonia" replaced the former name maarahvad "people of the earth" by J. V. Jannsen, the founder of the newspaper Pärnu postimees in 1857.
Notes

C XIII B. The term was used for the Baltic-Finnish population of Libya.
In this sense, in ancient Russian sources, it can be matched by an exotic "monster".
Estii of ancient authors
Aestii near Wisla (neighborhood of the Vivivors) is a people mentioned by Tacit in the tract "On the origin of Germans and the location of Germany":
The Estias worship the great mother of the gods, and as a distinctive sign of their worship, carry images of vervain on them; they replace them with weapons, and they protect those who worship the goddess even in the midst of enemies.
Their swords are rare; they are the ones most likely to use Drecole.
They grow the bread and other fruits of the earth more hard than they do of the Germans, and they do not like it, and they scour the sea on the shore and on the ground, and they collect the amber which they themselves call gloss.
It is not used in their own selves; they gather it in kind; they bring it to our merchants as raw, and they are surprised to receive the price for it.
Original text (lat)
According to this description, the aesthesia is one of the Western tribes of the ancient balls that collected amber and exported it to the Roman Empire on the Amber Road.
Tacit's name for amber in the aesthetic, glesum, probably of German origin.
There is no reason to identify with the Estonians those who spoke to Cassiodore in 537 and the people of the istii (Hestii) who were referred to by Jordan as danaries of Hermanarih.
It is not possible to define the exact range of their settlement in such a short way that the ancient authors mention the estranged ests.

The exact etymology is unknown, but there are some versions of the tone:
Economy
One of the coal-producing industries was the cotton mill (CBC), which was among the largest in Central Asia and has been operating since Soviet times.[23] Until recently, the silk mill (Osh-Gibek AO), the submersible pump plant, the textile unit (Texterator AO).[24] The city is supplied with electricity by Osh TEC.
Trade
Historically, the central market on Bazarna Street in the centre of the city on the left bank of the Aq-Buura River is the centre of trade in the city.
(1) There is a tradition that King Solomon (Sulaiman) once led an army in one of his quests, and he drove ahead a couple of oxen loaded into the plow.
As soon as the oxes were even with the famous peacock, the king liked the place for the pier, and he cried out to stop the animals: "Hosh!" - "All, enough!" - it's exclamation and gave the name to the future city.

Edward Anthony Jenner (May 17, 1749, Berkeley, Gloucestershire – January 26, 1823) was an English doctor who developed a vaccine against natural smallpox[1], inoculating a non-human cow smallpox virus.
First head of the octopus bed in London (1803).
Edward Jenner was born on May 17, 1749 in Berkeley, England, in Gloucestershire.
His father, Reverend Stefan Jenner, was Berkeley's vicar, so Edward received a good primary education.[4]
Received medical education in London.
At the age of 14, he was transferred from a local surgeon, Daniel Ludlow, who continued his studies in London.
There he studied anatomy and worked with patients, then was a practicing doctor and a surgeon in Berkeley's home.
In 1792, Jenner received a medical degree from St. Andrew's University, "Study of People's Funds".
Kashkai (samonaname: qa·kaylar, ed. - ka~kay, azerb. qa·kaylar, pers. ~ ~ ~ ~ ) is a group of Turkish-speaking tribes in the region of Fars, Khuzestan and southern Isfahan in Iran. According to Iran, the Kashkian tribal union is a conglomerate of clans of different ethnic origins, most of which include lourns, Kurds and Arabs.[2]
It has common roots with Shahsevens, who are sub-ethanos of Azerbaijanis.[3][4]
According to some sources, the cashews speak a cashaic language close to Azerbaijani,[5][6] according to others, the Kaskai language is a dialect of Azerbaijani.[4][7][8][9][10][10][12][13][14][15][16][17].
Origin and name
During the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries, various European and Russian authors made a number of assumptions about the origin of the coscaians and, consequently, the origin of their name.
M. S. Ivanov cites this as evidence of the heterogeneity of the coscaean tribes, which at different times were composed of various predominantly Turkic elements.[19] Soviet Armenian historian B. P. Balayan, however, criticized them all in the 1960s.
Language
They call their tongue "türkzy"[1].
For example, according to a version supported by V. W. Bartold, J. Demorenyi and some Iranian historians of the nineteenth century, the Kalashkai were separated from Khalaj, one of the goose tribes that began to be based in Iran since the eleventh century, in the area of Kum Sawa-Sultanabad of Persian Iraq, which was called Khalajistan, and from there was carried to Fars.
Balayan, on the other hand, pointed out that the theory of Khalaj origin was not valid, considering that the existence of a small tribe of Khalj among several tens of coscaian tribes did not make it possible to link the origin of all Kashka to the Khalaja.[22]

American historian Pierre Oberling, author of an article by the Encyclopedia of Iran on coscaeans, referring to their origins, like Balayan, identifies Iran's Azerbaijan as the original of the coscaians.[2]
Like Balayan, he argues that a large number of tribal names, such as Muganlu, Ak-Kyunlu, Kara-Kyunlu, Beigdali and Musella, refer to the region.

History
Once upon a time there was a beacon built in VI in. [source not specified 401 days]
After the Genoese snatched the area from the Byzantine and founded their colony here, they began building defensive walls around it in 1341.
From 1348 to 1349, a tower was built on top of the hill by the Genoa.
They then called it "Christ Tower," and it served as a reference point for navigators and traders.
Small fragments of the defensive wall and the lava have survived until our time.
The tower received its present name during the Ottoman Empire.
Sultan Mehmed The Conqueror reduced the height of the tower by 6.8 metres, removing the dome.
The tower was used as an observatory during the reign of Sultan Mourad III (1574–1595).
In 1632, the tower became the starting point for one of the first flights in history.
A scientist named Hesarfen Ahmet Cheleby reportedly jumped from a tower on homemade wings, flew across Bosphorus and landed safely in the Asian part of the city, for which he was awarded a sultan, and later exiled to Algeria.
In 1791, the tower was reconstructed, with a height of 45 m. The 1832 reconstruction affected the upper part of the tower, with the appearance of an observation site.
The guard on duty monitored the occurrence of fires and disturbances in a part of the town on the northern bank of the Golden Horn.[1]
In 1875, the tower became close to modern appearance.
In 1964-1967, the tower was restored, and the conical dome was rebuilt.
Later, an elevator was built into the tower.
At present, a restaurant, a nightclub, and an observation site are located in the upper part of the tower.
It is a museum object.
After the capture of Constantinople (now Istanbul) by the Turks in 1453, this small fort remained intact and was used for defensive purposes.
Later, a wooden beacon was built at the site, turned towards the Marble Sea.
During the Ottoman Empire, the tower largely served as a beacon to guide ships at night and even during the day into cloudy weather.
In the storm, small ships were tied to the tower for safety so that they would not be carried away by waves.
Guns were fired from the tower during the official celebrations.
In addition, the tower was occasionally used for different purposes.
Sent or sentenced to death, courtiers were kept there before being sent to the stage or to be executed.
The tower suffered from devastating earthquakes and fires on several occasions, and during one of the fires in 1720 almost completely burned down.
The great Viser, Damat Ibrahim Pasha, rebuilt the tower from stone this time, adding a tower with a lead roof and many windows.
In 1829, the Virgin Tower served as an isolation hospital during the cholera outbreak.
Shortly after, in 1832, during the reign of Mahmoud II, the last major repairs to the tower were completed.
In 1857, the tower was placed under the guidance of a lighthouse management committee, and a French company was instructed to rebuild the tower into a functioning lighthouse, which was fully automated in 1920.
The tower has been used as a beacon for almost a hundred years.
After 1923, the government stopped using the tower for its purposes, and it became just a beacon.
In the hard years of World War II, the tower was repaired, strengthening its internal structures with concrete.
After 1965, the tower was handed over to the Navy and served for some time as a military communications centre.
Then, in the second half of the twentieth century, in the Strait of Bosphorus, the movement of ships from around the world became more intense, with the number and size of ships flying here increasing.
From that moment on, it's time for quiet and rest for the Girl's Tower.
Since 1983, the Turkish Maritime Administration has used the tower as an intermediate traffic control point in the Strait.
At the beginning of 1989, the attention of the public was again tied to the Bosphorus girl.
One report under the heading "Girl's Tower Poison" reported that cyanide was stored there, which was used to poison parasites on ships in shipyards.
When a cyanide warehouse was destroyed in the dock, this deadly poison was transferred to the tower because "there was nowhere else to store it".
So poisoned the lonely Bosphorus girl.
However, there was a serious problem in the report: if the vapours of the substance had exploded, Istanbul would have been shaken by a terrible explosion.
For eight months, the press and television both reported this danger.
As a result, the problem was resolved when cyanide containers were moved to another location.
Not surprisingly, in May 1992, a group of young poets went to the Girl's Tower and, with the help of the mayor, announced their desire to turn the almost abandoned tower into a cultural center.
So when art exhibitions, photography, and even concerts began to take place in the tower, she came to life for a while.
During this brief period, the tower was referred to as "the Republic of Poetry".
In its long history, the tower has been a beacon, a prison, and a quarantine facility.
In 1943–1945, the tower was re-established on a 19th-century pattern.
A restaurant is currently located in the tower.

History
In 411 B.C.E., during the wars between Athens and Sparta, Byzantius took the Spartan side.
So the European part of the Bosphorus Strait moved to Sparta, and the Asian part to Athens.
In the end, Athens won, but for a while they took no action on Byzantine.
The winners chose to take control of the Strait of Bosphorus and collect taxes from ships passing through it.
There are several versions of the tower.
In one version, the Girl's Tower was built by the Finnish general Alquiviad to control the arrival of Persian ships in the Strait of Bosphorus.
He built a tax office on a rocky bank.
However, there is no mention of the existence of a tower at that time.
On the other hand, the tower was built during the reign of Emperor Constantin the Great as a guard tower.
Curultai (mong.
Huralday (Hural) is a historic convention of all Mongol and Turkish princes and nobles, an organ of people's representation in Mongol (in Mongolia, Buryatia, Kalmakia) and some of the Turkmen peoples (Nogais, Bashkir, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Crimean Tatars, Tatars, Tuvans, Altais), and a popular congress of nobles to resolve important State issues, to a certain extent similar to European parliaments (such as the Kurultai of the Republic of Bashkortostan).
Mongolian Kurultai
The notion of curultai as a popular convention came into play only at the turn of the 12th to XIIIth centuries, when Chenghishan united the small Mongolian tribes that lived until then every isolated life.
This word is mentioned for the first time in the last 282 section of the Mystery Mongols in the form of "Yeke Curilta".
1206 was a curultai at the source of the Onon River, where Temuchin was proclaimed to be Genghishan, and the creation of their Mongol Uls (the Great Mongol State) was announced.
1229 was a Kurultai who was chosen by Ugaday.
It was decided to complete the conquest of Jin's empire.
1235 is a curultai convened to formulate the State's further foreign policy.
The marches against Koryo; bulgar, men and Rusi; South China (Sun); and additional troops to the Middle East were resolved.
1246 — at the death of Ugaday, Guyuk was to become a Khan; but his enemy Batya deliberately refused to go to the Kurultai, which was thus delayed for three years and finally gathered without Batya.
This curultai, one of the finest, is also interesting to see, among the many statesmen and owners, the Russian great prince, Jaroslav Vásvolodovich, and among the foreign representatives, Plano Karpini.

The definition of Kurultai is given by Ilyhan Ahmed Tekuder (1282–1284) in a letter to the Egyptian sultan Sayf Al-Din Kalaun: "We have convened a curultai, i.e. a meeting that sets out the views of all brothers, children, important emirs, military commanders and private officers" (under the emirs, courtiers and State officials are understood here).

Homei is one of the five main techniques of the Tuvin people's throat singing.
It is the Tuvin sound extraction technique that uses the scientific term "chorecter" (breasting).
The uniqueness of this art is that the artist extracts two and sometimes even three notes at the same time, thus forming a sort of multi-vote solo.
Main techniques of Tuwin throat singing
There are also more than fifty varieties.
For example, duchuchaar (nasalization), dag kargyraza (gorky kargyraa), hova kargyraza (stepper kargyraa), boga homey (big homey), and kargyraa singer Oidupa.
The throat singing has been known in Central Asia since ancient times, and the throat singing has been spread by many nations: the Mongols, the Twins, the Kazakhs, the Altaians, the drillers, and many others.
The boy sang high in the mountains, singing so beautifully that even the richest people came to listen to him sing.
The receptions of the Twin performers are unique, for example:
Mr. Maxima Dakpai; Mr. Ak-oola Kara-Sala; Mr. Gennady Tumata, Kashteer; Mr. Oorjaka Hunastaar-Oola, Chorretteer; Mr. Aldin-Ool Seveka and others.
The famous performer of the Tuvan throat is Kaigal-Ool Hovalyg.
The Western public is better known as Ondar Cočgar-hol.
Also popular among Kazakh public opinion is the performer of the cargyraa style, Edil Husainov.

Singing is a technique of singing with unusual articulation in the throat or throats that characterizes traditional (especially cult) music of the peoples of Siberia, Mongolia, Tibet, and the Turkic peoples.
The essence of throat singing is that the singer sings two sounds at the same time: the main and the Oberton to him.[2]
Directions
Singing of throats is characteristic of the culture of a number of Turks (Turks, Tophalars, Altais, Baskirs, Hakas, Yakuts, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz), Mongol (Mongols, Buryats, Kalmaki) and Tungu Manchu (Ewenki) peoples.
The Altas and the Hakas have a style of kai, hai, primarily designed to perform long epic stories.
The throat singing of the bashkir is called the knot.
In Yakuts, it is called "habari shiat."
By sound and execution technique, this ancient Yakut style is identical to the Tuvin "kargyraa" style.
Tuvin's throat singing uses a chorecter.
Often, throat singing in general in Mongolia and you are referred to as a homomy, as it is the most common and internally diverse style in the region.
In Tibetans, throat singing is used for the speech of the Buddhist canon, and in Tibetan tradition there are a number of training institutions that prepare throat singers in a specialized manner.
Among them are the Gumé Monasteries (Hudmed) and Guto.
There is throat singing in the cultures of the South African Coss people, where it is called umngkolo[3][4] and Canadian Inuit (katajjaq[en] or Iirngaaq[5]).
In both peoples, women are traditionally represented.
In Europe, herding is used by shepherds on Sardinia.

Usually, the throat singing consists of the main tone (low-frequency "buzzing") and the upper voice, which moves along the tones of the natural sound band (usually 4 to 13 Obertons).
Obertons are well heard when sound components are reinforced by changing the shape of resonating mouth, throat, and throat.
This allows the singer to produce several tones simultaneously.
Turkish kaganat
Ashina is a noble genus of the rulers of the Kyrgyz Kagans in VI–IX W.
Genetic studies of the Ashin representatives
Based on the tests of the descendants of the Boman Kagan, scientists have concluded that the Ashin clan belonged to the branch of Z93, Z94+, Z2123-, Y2632-haplogroup R1a[24].

Origin of Ashin
A well-known traditional Tamga Ashin was a schematic of a mountain goat.
The majority of researchers: H.V. Haussig, A.N. Bernstam[2, Y.A. Zuev[3], D. G. Savinov[4], S. P. Goushchin[5], Rona-Tash[6], R. N. Fry[7], Findley[8], V. W. W. Mahpirov[9] have made a hypothesis about the Saco-Usun (Somdi) origin of Ashin: they believe that the roots of the ethnic group "Ashina" should be found in Saco-Usun descent anthroponemia.
Carter Findley believes that the non-jurk name, Ashina, which referred to the clan, probably comes from one of the Iranian languages of Central Asia and means "blue", kök in the Turkmen language, the color identified with the east, from which the name of the curk is derived.[10]
The genetic tree of the Ashin dynasty
The founders of the dynasties are the Booman (Art.) and Istemi (Mill. branch) of the Cagana, and the Throne succeeded by a stairwell principle: "The eldest brother is inherited by the younger brother, the nephew of the uncle."
The people of the tribe held the highest office of the abga — the first face after the Cagana — and the heirs of the throne — the Tegin, the Shad.
The kagan title was worn only by members of the Ashin family, and the tribal leaders were called runners.[35]
East branch
H.V. Haussig[1] and S.G. Klashtor[11] suggest a connection between the name of the Ašin and the ancient Persian Axen [a]na - "blue" / "sky"[12], hence and later the second name of Ashin's turquoise as "gök-turque" (blue, celestial).
As one of the hypothetical prototypes of the name Ashin S.G. Klashtorny also identified Saxan as "worthy, noble".[13]

Japanese researchers believe that Ashina in the original sounded like Ashinas and was one of many türk tribes, as well as a royal family.
Ashin &apos; s origin may have been of Tungu origin, or a Tunisian word among Alta.[15]
L. N. Gumileuve[16], N. I. Bichureen[17], M. I. Artamonov[18] concluded that the representatives of the Ashin dynasty, who were ruling in the Turks' Cahanats, were of Mongolian origin.
The ancient turks are a historic people in Central Asia, formed as a result of the mixing of the local Altai population with the native family of Ashin.[1]
The Turk ethnic group was formed in mixed forms of European-Mongoloid forms, so it carried both Mongoloid signs and a brahicran European complex during its settlement to the west.[2]
Terminology
Byzantine sources refer to the Turkic tribes as skeefs () [17][18].
In the Pechlevian springs, tours are referred to as Turkic tribes.[19]
The ancient twigs and the ruling dynasty of Ashin
The image of Prince Kul-tegan with the crown and the image of the Homo bird.
According to ancient Chinese sources, tugs (kit t\jué) come from the Gunn[20][21].
On Altay, an alliance of local tribes has been formed around the Ashin tribe, calling it "turquo"[24].
During their existence in the mountains of the Mongolian Altai Tughu, they were under the control of the Shuan-juan and were dependent on them until mid-VI in [25]
In order to achieve a terminological difference between ancient prison and modern-day türkic peoples, researchers have used and applied a variety of terms.
L. N. Gumileuve version
L. N. Gumileuve wrote that the "500 families" of Ashin, the future Mongolophones, came to V of Ordos and settled on the southern slopes of Altai, where the Turkish-speaking population already lived.
Both ethnic components merged.[38] Also according to L. N. Gumiliewu, the merger of Mongolophone aliens with the Turkish-speaking local population was so complete that by a hundred years, by 546 they represented the integrity that was commonly referred to as the ancient people or the turquoise.
The term "turquoise" was introduced by L. N. Gumileuve.
The Chinese called the ancient turquoise whale (kit. txjué), so some Russian-speaking researchers call the people turquo turquo or Tugu (u. N. Y. Bichinin Tukue).
Another group of names comes from interpretations of "kök türk" (kök türk) in the Kocho-Zaydamian inscriptions.[4] Some researchers refer to the literal translation of "blue turks", "sky turks", understanding the expression as the self-name of ancient turks, while others criticize the idea by pointing out that the kyok-türks in the inscriptions are clearly opposed to the rulers.
The interpretation of "gays and turquoise" in the sense of "Ashina and turks", "eastern" and "free" turquoise[4], "indigenous nomads".

To protect against their raids, Qin Shihuandi built the Great Wall of China.
Hunnah was actively engaged in wars with the Chinese Han Empire, in which they consolidated themselves into a single power that subjugated the tribes of neighbouring nomads.
Later, as a result of the wars with China and the Sianbi, as well as the strife, the Hong Kong Power fell apart.

Hong Ceramics at the Kehtin Regional Museum
China's history of the junta did not appear before the fifth century B.C.E., when their attacks on the settled population of northern China prompted the Chinese to begin building separate fortresses, which were later merged into the Great Wall of China.
The threat from the junta increased in the third century B.C.E., when nomads formed a powerful tribal union led by the Shanyuh ruler.
The Hong Kong Power covered a large part of Mongolia and South Siberia, extending from Manchuria in the east to Pamir in the west.
Hunnah was a fine horseman, and their army consisted of 300,000 horse archers.
The wheels that formed the basis of the Chinese army were difficult to resist, and the construction of the Great Wall of China was designed to secure the northern borders of China from the junta, but the task was not fully accomplished.
Chinese rulers have tried to lure nomads to Chinese ways of life with rich gifts and diplomacy, and many Chinese princesses have been married to junta leaders.
About 50 B.C.E., the empire split into two parts: the eastern junta recognized the primacy of the Chinese emperor, and the western junta was displaced to Middle Asia.
Some elements of the Gunn material culture (engraving with the Noin-Ulin type) are discovered in the "wet towns of the Priarala," and these elements are being developed in western Kazakhstan.
The discovery of the Gunnes graves on the lower Volga is of great importance, and some of them relate to I-II W.C.E. and indicate early entry of the Gunns to the eastern borders of Europe.
Hunnah is known from ancient Chinese sources and archaeological excavations of their monuments, the first of which were carried out at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century by Y. D. Talko-Grintsevich (Judician graveyards near the city of Kahta), followed by the most significant discoveries at the beginning of the twentieth century by P. K. Kozlov (Noin-Ulin Kurgans in the Selenga Valley).[2]
Organization of the Power
Chanyu (the greatest) was named the chief of the 24 elders of the junta.
The Shanyus were initially elected at the convention of elders, but Maudé founded the Shanewi dynasty.
The Shanyu election was preserved as a conditional procedure for the transfer of power to the new Chaney, which was indicated in the previous will [source not specified 252 days].
Hunn births
Rhode Shanyuev was called Xi Luandi, and the Huunnah had three noble breeds: Huyan, Lian, Xubu.
According to Gumileuv's guess, the "swan" family came from the Chinese Prince Shawn Wei, who took wives only from these births, and important positions in the Power were also transferred within these names, so that Xubu was a judge.
The rest of the births were attended by elders who had their own troops.[The source does not indicate 252 days].
Hunnas are about 1300–300 B.C.E.
Ethnicity
Gustav Ramstedt assumed that the Hunnu language reflected a state in which the Turkmen languages had not yet separated from the Mongol languages,[23] but that view was now clearly outdated, since the division of the Altai languages was now considered to be earlier.[24]
Mongolian theory
The Mongolophoneism of the juntas is the oldest view of the origins of the juntas in the history of history.
In the 18th century, P. S. Pallas put forward this theory, and in the 19th century, Rashpunzag[en], W. Bergman, I. Schmidt, G. N. Potanine, C. F. Neyman, H. Howors[en], A. Terry, N. I. Bichureen and others developed Mongol theory.
Mongolian origin was defended by A. Louvsandendev, B. Renchin, B. Munkachi.[28]
A number of modern Russian historians follow the Mongolian version of the origin of the juntas: A. P. Obatnikov, N. N. Dik, G. N. Rumyantsov, M. V. V. V. Vroboyov, B. B. Dushibalov and others.
Turk theory
The Turki theory of origin of the junta is now one of the most popular and less proven in the world scientific community.
Supporters of the Hutu theory include E. Parker, Jean-Pierre Abel-Remuse, J. Claport, G. Ramstedt, Annemary von Gabein, O. Prizak, L. N. Gumiliov and others.[42]

In the 10th century B.C.E., the junta gradually moved from the southern outskirts of Gobi to the north.[13]
L. N. Gumileuve believed that the junta itself had mastered nomadic pastoralism and learned how to cross deserts.
In the 300 years since the relocation to the north, the number of juntas has increased and they attacked Zhou in 822 B.C.E. The Chinese have escaped the raid, and the junta has not been mentioned for 500 years.
At that time, there was a culture of tile graves in the steppes of eastern Mongolia and Zabaikal.
Anthropologically, the tile grave cultural host belonged to the Paleosibir type of Mongoloid race, to which anthropologists also refer to the junta, the dunch and the sianbi.
Hongnah of Western Mongolia, Altai and Xinjiang, is characterized by a small European contamination.[1][14]
Modude, Maodun[1], Modun[2], in the Turkish tradition of Metehan (kit. ], 234–174 B.C.E., was the founder of the Hunnu Empire and its ruler (Shanuy) from 209–174 B.C.E.
In the year 201 B.C.E., Liu Ban appointed Prince Han Shin as the ruler of the Dai region, with the capital in May.
Maudé has laid siege to Mai and Han Xin without fighting, so the junta has reached the central regions of China, and they have crossed through Gauzhu, set siege to Tayuan (Taiyuan) and Jiangang.
Han Gao-zu gathered his troops and led him against Maudé in 200 B.C.E.
Three out of 10 Chinese warriors froze their fingers because of frostbite.
Modé retreated, and 320,000 Chinese army chased him, and Gao-Zsu, with the choice horse, fell off the infantry.
At the village of Baidin (5 km per y-v from Pichinchen, now Datun), the overpowering forces of the junta surrounded the Emperor.
For seven days, the junta was besieged by the Emperor's camp, and Maudé divided his cavalry into four parts: north, raven horses, west white, east gray, south red, but could not take over the camp. Han Gao-zu sent the lazers with gifts to Yanji[6] Maudé's wife. She told her husband that the Emperor was a "genius man" and better to negotiate with him.
Maudé did not receive help from his Chinese allies, Wang Juan and Zhao Li, and, fearing treason on their part, decided to release the emperor.
In 174 B.C.E., Maudé died.
The Hong Kong Power under Maudé
Legend
According to legend, Maudé was the eldest and unloved son of Shanyu Toumun, who sent Maudé to the Yuechjas who demanded the hostage.
Toumun planned to raid the Yuechi so that the Yuechs would have to kill their son, but Maude anticipated his father's intentions and, at the start of the raid, killed his guard and fled.
Udol Maudé had such an impression on the Guns that Touman had to put him in charge of one of the State's goods, putting 10,000 families in control.
Maudé began to train the warriors.
He turned a whistle-blowing arrow and ordered the warriors to shoot in the direction where he would put the arrow.
Failure to comply with the order was punishable by death.
One day, he shot an arrow at his favorite horse, and those who hadn't fired had their heads cut off.
Then he shot his beloved wife, and he decapitated those who did not shoot.
After all, Maudé shot his father, not one of the soldiers risked following his example.
In 209 B.C.E., he became the ruler of the Gunn.

First camping
Maudé concluded a peace treaty with the sobers, and the eastern nomads of the Dunhu demanded the best horses as a gift.
Some juntas wanted to start a war because of it, but Maudé gave the horses to execute the dissenters.
Then the dunch was asked by the most beautiful women, including the wife of Shanyu, and Maudé also gave the women, believing that the existence of the state was more expensive than that of women, who refused to give their wives to Maudé cut off their heads.
Finally, the dunch was demanded by the border desert lands, which some juntas offered to give up without resistance because no one lives there, but Maudé said that land was the foundation of the state and could not be given.
He once again executed those who disagreed, went on a field trip and smashed them back from the camp, and Mode started a war with the Yuechi and defeated them, and now it's time for the Hunns to return the lands previously conquered by the Qin Empire.
To that end, Maudé conquered the tribes of Lowfan and Bayan in Ordos and raided Chinese lands in Yang and Dai, headed from there to the cities of Chaona and Lushi, and again to Yan and Dai.
The Maudé army received almost no resistance, as Liu Ban fought with Xiang Yuy at that time.
Teleuts (samonage: telenet, Tadar, Bayat pachat) are an indigenous small people in the Russian Federation, based on the Turkish-speaking nomad population of the south of Western Siberia.
The language and culture of teleuts are closely linked to the language and culture of Altas, whose ethno-territorial group they were officially considered until 1993.[2]
Modern televisions are compact in the southern regions of Kemerovsky province.
The television network, as well as the telengite and the Telus, goes back to an ancient ethnic body.
The history of the body's people is seen from the early Middle Ages.
In 391 they were tabgaced, and in 403 they were buzzed.
In the 480s, the body was able to achieve military success (Gaochan's taking away, Yuebani's destruction) and to create the Allied Chinese State of Gaogyu, but soon it collapsed and the bodies were defeated by ephthalites.
At the beginning of the VI, a body headed by the princes of Mivot and Yife fought with buzz, killed Khan Futu, but in about 550 they were subjugated and became subjects of the Turki and later of the Eastern Turkic Kagans.
From 930 to 1207, televisions were not part of any military-political alliances and were apparently self-sufficient.
There is no reliable historical record of this period of time, life or activity.
The extent of this independence and centralization of tele-utility remains a discussion issue in the literature.
The 16th-century television series on the map of G. Luchynsky
In Russian written sources, TVs under the name of White Kalmicks were first mentioned in 1601.
In his "Description of Tombol Province of Siberia in its current situation, October 1734", the historian notes:
According to L. P. Potapov, teleuts have a unique role in the ethnogenetic formation of all groups of Altas, both northern and southern.
In teleuts, Y chromosomal haplas R1a1 (55.3%), C3xM77, N1c1, R1b*, R1b3, I, J[3][4][5] are defined.
Culture and religion
Orthodox, traditional beliefs remain.
It's a culture that's close to calfs and hacks.

Number and settlement
There are 2,643 persons (2010), of whom 2,520 are in Kemerov province. Teleuts are predominantly rural residents.
About 2,000 people live in the villages of Bekov, Cheluhoev, the villages of Verkhovskaya, Shanda, and the villages of Novo Bachata in the territory of the Belov and Guriev municipalities.
These are the so-called Bachat televisions, which live on the rivers Big and Little Bachat (Bassain Obi).
Teleuts also live in the Novokuznetsk municipality of Kemerovsky province and the Shebalin municipality of the Republic of Altai.

Language
Teleutian is one of the Kyrgyz-Kypchak (Hakas) languages of the Kyrgyz group of the Altai language family as a separate language or, according to another classification, is a dialect of the South-Altai (altaian) language.
In the latter case, it is common not only in the Kemerov region but also in the Republic of Altai (the Chebalin Municipal Region, along the Katuni River and its tributary of the Sema River) and the Altay Province. According to official data from 2010, 975 people in Russia (about 37% of the teleuts) were fluent in teleutese.
At the same time, almost all teleuttes speak Russian.

Biography
The first Shane, known by name.
In his reign, the junta was constrained by the Yuechya, Dunhu, and Qin empire.
When the Qin Empire weakened, he was able to recover a part of Ordos because of the confusion.
As a co-conspired second wife, Touman put his eldest son, Maudé (or Maodun), hostage to the Yuechjas, and attacked them to kill Maudé.
Maudé, warned by a servant, fled, and after receiving his father's army, a strong Maudé killed Toumany and his younger brother.
Identification with Kara Khan
The Persian historian Hondemir and Khan Abu-L-Ghazi tell a story about Kara Khan, the son of Mongol Khan, who traveled in winter in Karacum and on the banks of Syrdarya, and in the summer in the mountains of Ulug-Tag and Kichik-Tagh (Sur. Ulutau).
And he had a conflict with his eldest son and his heir, Oguz, when he took Islam in secret from his father; so he intended to kill his son while he was hunting, but he was killed.
Jakinf (Bichurin) assumed that in this story, the name of Oguz was behind the name of the Junjevic Maudé, and his father, Kara Khan, was Tuman (Toman).[9]
Iakinf's opinion supports M. Soegov, which points to the resemblance of the primary lexical value of the names Tuman and Kara Khan: Tum/tun is translated as "night", "night", and the punishment/garage as "black" (garcles are "darkness").[10]

The history of ancient Uighurs, based on written sources, has been evident for almost a thousand years: from the emergence in the international arena of the Gooche tribal association, the Tegreg (high-tech) in the fourth century, to the XIIIth to the XVth century, when the ancient Uighurs finally became part of the New Nuighur or modern Uighur ethnic group of Eastern Turkestan and the yellow Uighurs of Gansu.
The historical life of the protohuigur tribes in the era leading up to this temporary period, i.e. earlier IV V, is not regenerable, but it is known that it is directly linked to the junta tribal union.
The ancient Chinese historical writings contain information that ancient Uighurs originated from dinlins.
The source of the Oichor lies with the nomadic people of Dinlin, who settled in Lake Baikal III in B.C.E.
In V V, dinlin reappears in the historical arena, since then known as telesands.
In the early chronics of the Tan dynasty, the ancient Uighurs were called Hueihe.
In 840, the Slags (the Yenish Kyrgyz) conquered Hueiga, and part of the population of the Uighur Kaganata migrated to East Turkestan, gradually moving from a nomadic way of life to a sedentary and merging with the local population of the Tarim Valley — the inhabitants of Yuyan, Shulay, Gui-Zi, and the Chinese who had moved to the Western Territory since the time of the Khan dynasty.
In the history of the ancient tribe itself, three main periods are distinguished:
The period of State entities in Mongolia and Jungaria (the IV-VIth-century nomadic peoples).
The period of early-state nomads — kaganats — in Central Asia (First Uighur kaganat, 647-689; Second Uighur kaganat, 744-840).
The period of the birth and long history of settled States in East Turkestan and Gansu, IX–XIII V.
The historical history of the tribe unions that preceded the formation of the two Uighur kaganats is very selective and does not provide a holistic picture of the Uighur history of the time.
More complete are the information relating to the following two periods of Uighurs history, their statehood in Mongolia, East Turkestan and Gansu.
According to N. I. Beechin, the ancient Uighurs and their predecessors Chi-di[4], dinlins (dili)[5] and Googhui (gaoji) were of Mongol origin.
In his view, the Googhui are descendants of Chi-di: they were first called dil; later they were called Googhu Dinlins and Oichorami.[4]
S. Shabalov believes that Chi-di, Dili, Gaogyu and Hoyhu (ohor) originally spoke Mongolian.[6][7]

In 2000, telexes were classified as indigenous small peoples of the Russian Federation (Government Decision No. 255 of 24 March 2000).
The 2002 All-Russian Population Census took them into account by a separate ethnic group with its own language, and the 2010 All-Russian Population Census was a sub-ethnos of the Altas.
Language
Tengit language is the South-Altai language (owned by the Altai language) of the Kyrgyz-Kypchak (Hakas) language of the Kyrgyz group of the Altai language family.
Settlement
At present, it is mainly the indigenous inhabitants of the southern regions of the Republic of Altai: the Uragan Municipal Region (south of the Teletz Lake along the Chulwigman River and its tributary of Bashkaus) and the Kosh Agach Municipal Region (in the Chuya Valley).
According to the 2002 census, the number of telexes in the Republic of Altai was 2,400.
However, the telegraphs themselves estimate their number to be at least 15,000.
In 2004, the Federation of Tengitas was established.
Tölös, Tölös, Tölös, and Tolis/Tulis are a genus of altais, Kirgiz, Tuvin, and Meskhetian Turks.

It is known that in 1703, the Yenisei Kyrgyz were relocated by the Junggar Khan Ceven-Rabdan to the areas of the Ilya basin and the Tian Shana hills, probably at that time when some of the Tölös were in Kyrgyzstan.
At present, the Tölös are a large group of Kyrgyz ethnicities.
And they're living there with mussels and hires, and they're scattered in a large area, from Osh province to Issyk-Kul.
Most of them are found in the Talas district of Kyrgyzstan.

According to L. N. Gumileuve, the body tribe is a relic of the turquoise.[2]
Other researchers of the genus of the teles connected with the ancient tribes of the body[3] (dinlin, Gaogyu).[4]
In ethnogenetic terms, the ancient tribes of the body are compared by L. P. Potapov with televisions, telexes and teles.[5]
S.P. Tolstoy identifies some telesian tribes with the goose tribes that were part of the 24th ancient Oguzo-Turkmen tribes under the Rodoslov Turkman Abu Al-Ghazi.[6]
However, there is a view of the Mongolian origin of the body and the prison tribe.
According to N. I. Beechin, the dinlins (dili)[8] and Googyu were of Mongol origin; in his opinion, the Googhus were first called dili and later called Googyu dinlins.
S. Shabalov believes that the televisions[10] and their predecessors dili, googhus and turquoise originally spoke Mongolian varieties.[10][11][12]

Tophalar reindeer herders group
Language
The Tophalar language belongs to the Sayan group of East Türk languages.
According to the 2002 census, 114 people (16 per cent) of the 723 Tophalars in Irkutsk province spoke their mother tongue, and all 723 (100%) in Russian.[13]
A script has been developed for the Tophalar language, and a letter and teaching aids have been issued.
Studying the Tophalar language began in the mid-19th century.
Since the 17th century, close contacts with the Russians have led to many Russian borrowings in the Tophalar language, and some tophalars have been translated into Russian.
In addition, due to rather close contact with the boreholes, part of the Tophalars knew the Buryat language.[1]
After the forced transition to a sedentary lifestyle and the organization of Tophalar villages, where Russians lived together with the Tophalars, and the Tafarar language was not taught in schools open in the villages, the exclusion of the Tafarar language from the Russian language began.[1]
During the Soviet years, the risk of extinction of the Tophalar language was particularly high.
However, since 1990, the teaching of the native language of the Tafarar children in kindergartens and schools has been fuelled, while attempts have been made to revive national rites and traditions, despite these efforts the Tofalar language is extinct.
Name
The name tophalara was established relatively recently, in the 1930s, and is derived from the self-named tofalar, in Tophalar, toph (as opposed to the other peoples of the North using the self-titled "human", the Tofalar word toph as such has no meaning.
Until the 1930s, this people had a different, totemical name: Karagas, which supposedly translates as black geese. It may have originally been the name of one of the Tophalar births, and later it spread to the entire people.
According to most researchers, the Karagas were travelling in the area at the time of the arrival of the first Russian Kazakhs in the Udah valley.
At the same time as a sedentary life, the Soviet authorities gave the self-name of "karagasa" a negative shade in relation to its "steal" essence.
Since 1934, the official name of the Tophalars — Tofararia — has been established, with the exception of the former name Karagasia.[1]
Origin
Tofalars, tofars (formerly called Karagass, self-named tofa, tofa, topa, toha, and multiple tophalar) are the indigenous small people of Russia living in eastern Siberia.
According to researchers, the tofalars have emerged from the mixing of the ancient Quetophone and Samdian populations with the oak tribes that have moved to the Sayano Altaia region.[15]
Traditionally, the oak (tuba, tuha) is identified with the ancient Turkic tribes of the body.[16]
However, according to A. S. Shabalov, the body (i.e., oak) was originally a Mongolophone group of tribes that were jurized at the end of the fourth century C.E.[17][18]
The Y share of the haplas were N - 82% of them: N-L666 - 45%, N3a5a - 31%.[19]
For the first time, the tophs were referred to as the doubo tribe (tuba, tuvo) in the Chinese record of the Wei Dynasty of the Fifth Century as the people who lived east of Yenisei.[20] They were Dancers of various Central Asian empires.
In the 17th century, Tofalaria joined the Moscow State by becoming a border territory with China, and after 1757, when Tuwa joined the Manchür Empire of Qin, Tofalaria remained a member of the Russian Empire, with considerable administrative and cultural (reclusive and welfare) influence from the Russians.
The Udine Lander was created administratively with five ulus in its composition, and for the Tophalars it was set with cannon and meat, and for certain years it was fixed and independent of the natural conditions and the actual number of hunters, and it was difficult to judge the exact number of people for the first time in the statistics (1851).
By the beginning of the 20th century, the Tophalar population had continued to show significant signs of tribal structure, in particular the division into five patrilineal births (Kash, Sarig-Kash, Chogdu, Kara-Chogdu and Cheptey; experts had established that there had been 8 such births) and the sanctuaries, which were divided between the patsy areas and the fishing areas.
Since the end of the 19th century, these changes have become annual due to the loss of forests by cannon animals.
In 1939, the Tophalar National District was established in the Irkutsk region of the RSFSR, with a centre in the village of Aligger, but it was abolished in 1950 and replaced by two Tophalar Village Councils, the Tophalar, with a centre in Aligger, and Verkhne Gutar, with a centre in the village of Upper Gutara, in the Nizhneudin district of Irkutsk province.
Business arrangements
Settlement
Before the 1920s, tophalars were a semi-nomadic hunting and reindeer herding people, the main hunting targets of the tophalars were protein, sobol, otter, beaver, fox, moose, maral, cosul and other taiga animals.
After the transfer to sedentary life, the tophalars were combined and moved to land and livestock farming, but subsequently abandoned their activities, mainly through logging, wood processing, brick making, carpentry, stoveing and finishing.

From the end of the 17th century until 1925, the number of Tophalars was consistently between 400 and 500, and there was no written evidence of the people &apos; s extinction, presumably no change since the arrival of the Russians or their influence.
The Tofalark is the language of the Tofalar people, who live in the three rural settlements of Tophalar, Nephrin and Verkhnegutar, which are part of the Nizhnudi district of Irkutsk province.
The number of Tophalar speakers is 93 (2010 census) out of a total of 775 Tophalars.

In addition to the Tofalar language, the Thai group belongs to the north-eastern (Tojia) and south-eastern dialects of the Tuwin language (Togin, Pyi-Hem district of Tuwa) and the Soyot-Tatan language, which is falling into the Soyot language (Buriatia), the Tatian and Uighuro-Uryanghai Idioms (Mongolia), the last three are interpreted as the dialects of the same language, as the three close-born languages; and the Tsatian and Uighuro-Uryanhai languages are as close as possible to each other.
Written
Until 1988, Tophalar had no written language, and a phonical letter based on Latin and Russian graphics was used in the work of researchers to record Tophalar texts.
For example, Valentin Russadin, later author of the Tophalar alphabet, in 1978, in his work "The Morphology of Tophalar Language in Comparative Illumination", accepted the entire Russian alphabet for the transcription of Tophalar words, with the addition of additional signs,,,,,,,,,,, i.
The transcription was based on a background principle with elements of morphological[3] actually adopted in the form of an official script adopted in 1988 with the following alphabet:
A B B in G g g o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o f x x o oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ oh oh oh ♪ oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  oh oh oh oh oh    oh oh oh        oh       oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The process of developing Tophalar writing is ongoing.
According to the 2005 edition of "Slovar of Tophalar-Russian and Russian-Tophalar", the current alphabet has 41 letters and reads as follows:[4]
A B B in G g o o o o o o o o o o y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o oh o o o o o oh o o o o o oh o o o o o oh o o o o o oh o o o o o oh o o o o o o o o o o oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o
The Uryanhai province (Thudáda Uryanhai, a whale of a traditional land) is the Russian name of Tuwa in 1914–1921.
Until 1912, the province was under the control of the Manchhur Dynasty of Qing, which ruled China, under the authority of the China Chamber of External Relations, and was called Tannu-Uryanhai.
Kuzmin Y. V. Uryanhai in Russian-Mongolo-Chinese relations.
The term "Uryanh" is of Mongolian origin.
The Uryanhai, the Uryan, were referred to as the Russians in documents XVII to early 20th century.[3]
Since the 1870s, the settlement in the Uryanhai province of Russian peasants began and by 1909, 9,000 Russians had already lived there.[4]
After the Xinhai Revolution in China between 1912 and 1913, the Twin nuions (ambyn-noyon Combu-Dorju, Chamza Hamba Lama, Noion Daa-hosun Buyan-Badirga and others) have repeatedly requested the royal government to accept Tuva under the protectorate of the Russian Empire.
On April 4, 1914, Russia established a protectorate over the five hoshuns of Uryanhai province.[5]
The province was included in the Jenisey Province, with the transfer of political and diplomatic affairs in Tuwa to the Governor-General of Irkut.
The general administration of the province was formally in the hands of the Ambennoyon and, in fact, in the hands of the Russian Commissioner in the Uryanhai province and the official of the resettlement administration who was in charge of the installation of the Russian displaced persons.
Their residence was founded in 1914 at the village of Belozarsk.[2]
The population of the province was estimated at 73,000 at that time.[3]
Administratively, the Uryanhai province was divided into seven hoshuns: Beise, Daa, Maada, Oyunnar, Salchak, Tojinski and Chood.
In 1921 the People &apos; s Republic of Tannu-Tuva was proclaimed, and since 1926 it has been known as the Tuva People &apos; s Republic.
In 1944, the Republic was incorporated into the RSFSR as the Tuva Autonomous Region; in 1961 it was transformed into the Tuva ASSR; in 1992 it was incorporated into the Tuva Republic; and in 1993 it was transformed into the Tiva Republic.

Model text
From the poetic translation of Anatoly Prelovsky
I'm a snake with a golden head, and I've got my golden belly torn with a ruthless sword, and now I'm going to crawl out of the hole, my head is going to leave the house... that's, you know, not good.
I'm a brave tiger, standing, groaning in the rock.
You can see the head and the body's tense for jumping... and you know it's good.
Dropping a mirror in the lake in the morning is a woman crying in the evening... you know, it's bad, bad and sad.
A young man in the woods found the pissy tail of a cuckoo -- let him be like a sultan, pull him on a hat -- that's very good, they say, luckily.

Sources XIV-XVII Wt. on dwarfs
L. N. Gumileuve linked the origin of the dwarfs to the prison.
In his view, the dwarfs were descendants of the branches of the prison.[18][19]
In fact, the prisons, Gumiliev believes, were formed by the merger of Mongolophone aliens with the local prison-speaking population of Altai.[20]
Two dwarfs were found in the J2a-Z7706 team, which was previously found in the sakes.[27][28]

Origin of the word Shanyu
In the view of Allvolod Tuskin, the title "Shanyui" was formed by combining the two words Shan and Yu. The first syllable conveyed the word "Sunnu" from the origin of San to "honour", "respect", and the second syllable to "home".
The value of title is a "respectable or honored house" under whose roof was as if all around it, and the holder of that title was considered to be big like the sky.
According to [Wan Zhonghan], the hieroglyphs used to write the word "Shanui" were used in ancient tanyi (tanyi), which is an abbreviated ancient Chinese transcript of the Turkish word "Tangri-kut" (son of Neba).
Origin of the junta Monarchy
According to Chinese record sources, the ancestor of the junta was Prince Xia Chunway[3,] also called Hunnah Shiezu (the predecessor of Hunnah).
He took a nomadic life and became an ancestor of the junta of Luanthi dynasty.
It is noted that during Yu's time, the tribes of Hanyun, Hunyu, Shanjun, lived in the steppes of northern China, and Chunwei arrived with his family.
List of Xanyuev Hunnu
The Chanyuw dynasty at the junta was called Luanthi (Kit., op. cit., pinging Luántí).
There's never been a clear order of succession.
A testatorial inheritance was used, once again (brother to brother), and the Princes' convention was elected (not only from the direct descendants of Shanyu, but also from all his relatives).
Uighurs (Kit. Trud., op. cit., pinging huihu, pal. Hueihu, more often Hoyhu) were first mentioned in the history of the North Way era (354–386).
They were also referred to as whales.
They were part of a tribal union called the whale, pinging chilei, shooting.
This name was considered correct by Chinese historians, as opposed to whales. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪

Toumidou was buried with honor, and his son Swimming was appointed.
His historic predecessors were early-State nomads:
When Hallyg Yushbara-Jagbu Khan captured Beitin (north of the estate, precise location unknown), 50,000 Uighurs led by Pushbard beat him off, in the valley of Ore (river) Uighurs, together with the Chinese, defeated Ashhin Hal's army.
Soon the snorkel was raised and sent to war with Korea, and his son Bealy inherited the scent, and his reign was calm, with some territorial changes in Uighur lands.
After his death, his son, Duzzezhi, began ruling.
When Capagan Kagan returned the land he had lost, a part of the Uighur moved to Ordos, where they were enrolled in the imperial army.
After Duzzezhi, his son Fudith () became a Khan.
The Uighurs were at war with the turquoise and continued to move to Ordos. Chenjong, son of Fumidu, began ruling after his father's death.
According to Van Gyuncho, Governor of Liangzhou, Chenjong was deprived of his staff and died in exile.
In 755 An Lushan rose up against the Tan dynasty, and in 756 Emperor Su-Zun appealed to Moin-too-Kagan for help.
After the Battle of Loyan, the Uighurs robbed the city for three days and stopped only after a great deal of silk had been produced, and Tan sent 20,000 rolls of silk to help them and awarded them honorary titles.
In addition, the horse trade was recorded at 40 rolls of silk for each horse, and Uighurs were given the status of "guest" during their stay in Tansk China.[16] Tan and Uighurs contracted an exchange. Myung married Princess Ningo too much, and the Uighur princess married a Tan prince.

The first, the earliest kaganat, which was created in 323 in Hangay and existed for about 200 years; the second kaganat appeared in 523 and existed for just over 80 years, was destroyed by the Turk Cagant in 603.

A colonel named Kutlug declared himself the new cagan under the title of Ai Tengride Ulug Bolmish Alp Kutluk Külüg Bilge Kagan ("Great born in the moon sky, triumphant, glorious, great and wise kagan"), establishing a new dynasty, Ediz.
In 803 the Uighurs captured Kocho.[25] In 808 Kutlug died and was succeeded by his son Bo-i-han.
In the same year, Uighurs seized Liang prefecture from Tibetans.[26]
In 822 Uighurs sent troops to help Tan suppress the rebels.
Tan refused the offer, but had to pay them 70,000 pieces of silk to return home.[22]
In 823, the Tibetan Empire began a war with Uighurs.[27] In 824, Chin-de-han died and his brother Zhaoli-han succeeded him.
He was killed in 832.
He was succeeded by the son of Chin-de Külüg-run-han, and that same year the Tibetan Empire ceased fighting the Uighurs.
Decline
In 839 he was forced to kill himself, and the Minister named Külüg escaped the throne with the help of 20,000 Shato riders from Ordos.
In the same year, there was famine and an epidemic, especially severe winter, which killed most of the livestock on which the Uighur economy was based.[28]
They continued to destroy other cities throughout the Uighur power, burning them to the ground, and Uge Khan, son of Bo-i-han, became the kagan of the vandalized Uighur kaganat, and in 841 Uge led the Uighur invasion of Shenxi.
Kagans of the 3rd Uighur kaganate
140 years later, the third Uighur kaganat appeared in the territories of the former East Turki kaganata.
In 840, the State was destroyed after 20 years of war by the Yenisean Kyrgyz.
Under the whirlwind of the Kyrgys, Uighurs were pushed south into East Turkestan.
Their statesmen continued to exist in the west of Gansu and in Turfan Oasis.

Initially, up to 500 Uighurs[5] moved to the Shiray area on lands up to the middle of the Amur and to the Tatab (hi) lands on the territory of modern Inner Mongolia, but in 847 the Kyrgyz went to Amur against Uighurs and Shihei, and the Chinese went to the Hi tribe, after which this part of the Uighur also fled to East Turkestan.[6]

Kutlug I Bilge Pailo (Tron name whale, pinging gudulupigaquekehan, piling, Gudulupigaekuekhan, personal name whale, pinginging gulupeiluo, shooting.
Board
When he came to power in 744, Pailo moved the bet to Hara Balgas on Orhon.
The ward consisted of Tokuz-Oguz (Uygur), i.e. nine deliveries ( &quot; Yaloge &quot; or &quot; Yaglakar &quot;, &quot; Khuduge &quot;, &quot; Huduge &quot; or &quot; Uturkar &quot;, &quot; Hulow &quot; or &quot; Turlamvur &quot; (Kürlamvur), &quot; Mogeshichi &quot; or &quot; Bokasikir &quot; ( &quot; Box &quot; ), &quot; Audi &quot; or &quot; Avuchug &quot;, &quot; Gasapos; or Carsar &quot; (Kasar &quot; ), &quot; Huwasu or Hogorsov &quot;, &quot; Yauge &quot; or &quot; Yagame &quot;, &quot; Yabtukar &quot; or &quot; Yabtukar &quot; ).
Six television births were equated with Uighurs (buga, Hun, Byirku, Tongra, Sega and Kibi).
The 11 subjugated deliveries of Basmals and dwarfs were the vanguard of the Uighur army.
In foreign policy, Pailo was a supporter of the Tan Against Turk alliance.
In 745 Uighurs, the last Turkish kagan, Bymei-han Kulun-becka, was vandalized and Pailo ordered his head to go to Chan &apos; aan, for which the emperor generously thanked him.
For the next two years, the Uighur Power has steadily expanded, although it has not reached the size of the Turki Kaganata.
In 747 Pailo died and his son Moin became a kagan too much.
Myon too (Tron name whale, pinging geleikehan, pilling, galaikhan, personal name whale, pinging moyanchuoli, piling, Meinchuli) is a kagan of Uighur kaganate from 747 to 759.
Thanks to the partly preserved stone inscriptions, his rule is well known.
On the first day of the 8th month, Moin went on a camping trip when he was informed of his enemies approaching.
On the second, at the Salt Altyre Lake, Moin too crossed Cassui and took the fight.
The enemy was broken and retreated.
On the 15th, Moin caught up with them at Keir's key and Birku's river and crashed them again.
Half the Tartars joined him, half ran.
Kagan went to a winter party in the Etüken Mountains.
Board
After the death of the first Uighur Cagana, Kutlug I Bilge Pailo, his son Moin, too, took up the throne, after a hard war with a coalition of disgrunts.
He was considered a courageous and determined general.
Every year, he sent an emissary to the Tan court.
In the spring of 750, the kagan went to war against the people of the chicks in the valley of Enisa.
After the fight on the River Kem, the chicks obeyed.
In the summer, the kagan ordered the construction of a capital for him with palaces and walls.
Summer kagan spent in prayer, he also ordered that he begin recording the history of his exploits.
In autumn, the kagan went east to the Tartars, who chose to make peace with him.
At the beginning of 751, the kagan left for Etüken black and west of the Holy Key (ante ox), near the merger of Ibash and Tukusha, set up his palace and built the walls.
He ordered us to cut thousands of years and ten thousand years of signs on a flat stone.
Soon the kagan found out that the chicks, the Kyrgyzes, and the unknown (the writing erased) tribe had united against him.
On the 9th, the kagan went camping.
He's an ambassador to a thousand people and a little to their allies.
By intercepting the Allied race, the kagan learned that the dwarfs had not yet come to the rescue of the rebels.
On the 18th of the 11th month, the kagan met the dwarfs at Bolchu (Urungu).
Three dwarf tribes were broken.
He soon found out that his thousand men had taken over the chicks.
In the summer of 752, the kagan rested and prayed, and he appointed the hawks, the shrubs and the Tarhans to the chicks.
Soon the kagan was informed of the approach of his enemies (the inscription was not kept, which was not clear).
On the 15th, he gathered his troops from Lake Tigan and began to trap his enemies.
By crossing Kara-Yotaluk, the Cagana troops made the enemies come closer.
The unknowns (the inscription may have been damaged by the basmals) began to feed the dwarfs into the rebellion.
Soon the basmals approached the cagana.
Kagan calls a coalition of his enemies: the Türgesi, the three Carluk tribes, "the ox of the..." (the word "three Saints of the Three".
In the Etüken (Hangai) forests, Kagan attacked the coalition.
On the 26th of the 5th month, the kagan smashed them and continued to pursue them across the Ichui River.
742-745 prison war
In 753 the war resumed, but it was difficult to talk about the details because the inscription remained fragmented. In the eighth month, the kagan left Er Segun's bet on Lake Yula and pursued the basmals and the dwarfs.
By 755 kagans, after many battles, "destroyed" basmals and dwarfs.
The next reliable message is the command of the Cagan to send soda and tabgachi (Chinese from Tang) masters to build the city of Bai Balika in 756–757 years.
The war with the Tatars continued.
It appears that Shehu was executed for unknown reasons, and therefore the second son of Idigian became kagan.
The beginning of Moin-chuck's inscription has not been well preserved, but from the fragments, Moin's reminiscent of the state between Selenga and Orhon, in which the goads were travelling.
This is the centuries-old domination of a people over Uighurs and the 50-year-old rule of a prison (named "türk kibchak", turquoise-kirks).
It's probably a Kok-Turk kaganath who took over the Uighurs from 688 to 741.
Moin-chora's inscription
The inscription was found in 1909 by Professor G. I. Ramstedt, executed by the Orchon Runes.
He's talking about the history of the Uighur kaganat and the Moin-chora cases.

At the age of 26, he became a Shadow (about 742), and after receiving part of his father's troops Kutlug I Bilge Pailo, he went to war with the twigs.
After joining nine tribes (tokouse-hogs), he went south to Kaire (name of spring or mountains).
Not far from Keir and the three streams Birkyu, he ran into the Han army and pursued him, and it looks like he's overrun by the Yar River.
Next is the Hanukkah Ozmash-tegan.
In 743 (year of Ovtsa), Moin went too far against Ozmash-tegan, and on the 16th of the 1st month, there was a battle against the twigs.
Ozmégne and his wife were captured.
According to L. N. Gumileuve, the inscription was not properly removed and the Uighurs captured Bymei Khan Kulun-becka rather than Ozmich-tegan.[1]
The state of the prison was destroyed.
In 745 the Uighurs quarreled with the dwarfs, and the three Carluck tribes moved to the Western Turki kaganat.
The struggle for the throne.
747
At the beginning of 747 Moin overthrew the dwarfs, and soon Kutlug I Bilge Pailo died.
Myon-chora was challenged by another challenger, the Tay Bilge-Tutuk abga, and the sympathy of the commoners was divided (from the inscriptions of whose supporters there were no more).
Two armies met at a place called Bukagük.
The fight began tonight, while still in the sun, the Bilge-tuk army was scattered, but they gathered again at night.
At night, the Bilge-Tutuka troops left nine tribes of Tartar and eight tribes (probably dynamites).
At the rising of the second day, Moin too defeated and captured his opponent's Uighur elders.
Myon was too merciful to the common people, but soon they rose up again.
On the 9th of the 4th month, in Burgu Moin, too with the army, chased their rebellious fellow men and took away their women and cattle as punishment.
Kagan led his army north-west of Selenga to meet the Tartar and eight tribes (Kidan), and Vojsko Uighur climbed south of Yiluk Gola to Sip Bashi. On the 29th of the 5th month, Moin met his enemies and pushed them back to Selenge.
A part of the enemy, perhaps the Tatars, began to retreat down Selenge, and Moin went too far to chase.
By taking 10 men, Moin let them go and offered peace, he declared a truce for two months.

Kynak tribe Tamga
Kinyak is one of the ancient Oguzo-Turkmen tribes mentioned in medieval historians' writings.
The Seljuquid dynasty is coming from the Kynak tribe.
Origin
The Kinyak tribe was part of the 24 original Turkmen (Gouzian) tribes, originating from Oguz Khan, an ancient hero who produced Turkmen and other Turkmen peoples.
Information on the Turkmen origins of the Kynak tribe is provided by a prominent statesman and historian of the State of Hulaguid Fazlalah Rashid Al-Din in his work "Jami Al-Tavarih", chapter "Legends on Oguz Khan".
"Turkeman's tribal division":
"He had six sons, each of whom had four sons... DENGIZ-HAN – Yigder, Yive, Buqdus, Kinyak."[1]
The Hiven Khan and historian Abu-L-Ghazi also wrote about this in the work "The Holy Turkman":
"The name of the eldest son of Tengiz Khan is Igdir, the second [son] is Buqdys, the third is Ava, the fourth is Kinyak."
A well - known Russian and Soviet historian and easternist, V. Bartold, points out that the ruling Seljukid dynasty was from the Kynak tribe.
"The question of the attitude of the authorities towards the people from which they came was even more complex in the State of Seljuk's descendants than in the State of Karahanids.... Yet they recognized themselves not only as gouges or Turkmens, but also from the genus of Kynak (such a pronunciation is given by Mahmoud Kashgarski), one of the 24 (in Mahmoud Kashgarsky of 22) Oguz..."

Idigyang (trinical name whale dr., pinging moyukehan, pal. Myykehan, personal name whale dr., pinging yidijian, pill. Idiqjiang, title Tngridä que qu bulmš el tutm\\\\alp külüg bilgä kaäan[1]) was a kagan of the Uighur kaganate from 759 to 780.
He is known for the wars with China of the Tan Dynasty and the Tibetan Empire, as well as for his conversion to manichaea.
The war had another consequence that changed the fate of the Uighur kaganat.
In addition to the military trophies and prisoners, Idigyang brought Manihai priests from China who had since turned the Kaghan into a Manihayiya (762), and in 763 four Manihai monks proclaimed Mani's teachings as the official religion of the Kaganate.
In 768, the Manihei sent a request through the Cagana to the Emperor of China to open the Manihai shrines in the territory of the Empire.
The Emperor did not sympathize with the Manihai, but was forced to grant permission in 771.
In its Chinese version, the "Carabalgasunian inscription" is described in its three-language "Carabalgasun inscription" about the adoption by the kagan of manichaeism and the call by the nobles to follow it.
It is likely that the knowledge did not heed these calls, and after the murder of Idigyanya returned to the old customs, and the manihaea was finally established at Kutlug II.[3]
War with Tibetans 765-768
In 765 Pugu Huai'en[4] (en:Pugu Huai'en) rose up against the emperor and called for the help of Uighur and Tibetans.
Very soon Pugu Huaien died.
Without wishing to miss their chance, the Uighurs began secret talks with General Gui Jiai (in:Guo Ziyi) about joining China.
Guo Jii went to provocation and alone, unarmed, came to the Uighur camp and told them that the emperor had thanked them for their help and now the Uighurs should not be maliced against Tang. He also said that he was not afraid of dying at the hands of the Uighur and knew that in that case his enemies would avenge him.
The Uighur elders were afraid and swore that they would not enter China, but would attack the Tibetans, and they also asked to save the sons of Pugu Huayen because they were relatives of the Hanshee.

Preparations for the war with Tan 768-779
In 768, Hansha Guangzin () died. Sio Hinh was sent with condolences. In 769, Lee Han went to the Kagan with Chunway, the younger daughter of Pugu, who was adopted by the emperor.
She was now married to a kagan, with a dowry of 20,000 moths of silk.
In 778 Uighurs attacked Taiyuan without warning.
Bao Fang was caught by surprise and lost 10,000 people.
In 779 Tang Dae-Zun took the throne and sent an ambassador with a notification of Dai-Zun's death, but the kagan accepted it coldly.
The ambassador found out that the elders were encouraging the Kagan to war, but Khan Dulmaga-tarhan was trying to discourage the Kahan from war, saying that at best the Uighurs would get some livestock, and at worst, everyone would die in battle with the Thai army.
Kagan didn't listen to him, so Dulmaga Tarhan killed the Kagan and 2,000 Uighur nobles.
Perhaps the coup was linked to the struggle of crucial aristocratic births against the power of the ruling generation of Jaglacar[5]

After his father died, he took the throne.
Idigyang, who was associated with China's marriage to a Chinese princess, had a keen interest in the situation in Tan.
After the exchange of embassies, the kagan learned that Tan's situation was very precarious and sent his warriors to China to participate in an internecine war.
Entry into China 762 - 765
By 762 the kagan believed that Tan's house had been destroyed.
However, the messenger from Tang Dai-Zun brought a decree to the kagana as a Tan Vassala.
Idigian questioned the validity of such a decree, drawing the envoy's attention to the fact that central authority in the empire had weakened and many lands had been abandoned and herbed.
It seemed that Uighur's troops would be enough to conquer China, and Kagan was not demonstrating to the emperor and continued to move troops deep into China.
At first, Chan &apos; aan believed that there were 100,000 Uighurs in China.
When an official of Yo Jimao met the Uighurs outside the town of Tayyuan, after buying their commanders, he found out that the building troops were only 4,000, 10,000 more servants, and 40,000 horses, and that Idigyang and Hansha had come to the army and told the emperor that the Uighurs in China were only catching rebels.
However, the Kagan rejected three plans to attack the rebels, choosing to stay in Taiyuan and supply the army with local warehouses.
The situation of the Uighurs was made more difficult when they were squeezed by the imperial forces, with whom the plan was to join to fight the rebels: while Idigyang was arrogant with the Chinese princes, the Thai warriors were outraged and offered to destroy the Uighurs.
After learning that on 20 November 762, the imperial forces returned Loyan and completely put an end to the rebellion, the kagan sent congratulations and a banner to the emperor, and the Uighurs were camped south of Huanghe for three months and caused much damage to the local villages.
Soon the Uighurs took off and approached Tayuan, where they were met by Pugu Huaien, the well-known leader and father of Idigyang's wife, who had to leave China.
Manoeuvring
Dunmaga (Tranny name whale, pinging changshoutianqingkehan, palsy) is a kagan of Uighur kagana from 780 to 789.
The Uighurs accepted these terms, and Heqyue Dagan () went after Princess Xu Jiang () but did not take her, but received her portrait and took his kagana, and in 788 the Uighur Embassy went to fetch the king.
The Embassy was joined by counselor Jiade (-) with 1,000 escorts, the sister of Kagan Gudulu Piga (-) with 50 wives of princes.
The Shiwai tribe attacked the procession and killed 300 people.
The rest of the emperor was placed in the capital and graciously received.
Board
After the murder of Idyang Dunmaga, he took the throne as a Chinese kagan.
He immediately sent an ambassador to Chan'an.
In response, he was given the title of Wichengungehan through the Governor.
He also banished the Manichaeans because they were Idygian's favorites.
The execution of Todun Imishi
To accommodate Uighur elders, the Thai authorities allowed them to come freely to the capital for trade.
On one occasion, Prince Tudun Imisha of the Mayla family returned home from China's capital, and they stopped for Chenu () (now Internal A.R. Mongolia) and lived there at the expense of the treasury for three months, causing great unrest.
Zhang Guangcheng (,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He learned that Tudun Imish seemed to be taking his time in the horde, knowing that the kagan had begun to kill disgruntled elders.
The Uighurs caused a great deal of harm to the local population and, as it turns out, stole the girls in bags and sent them to Uighuriya for sale as slaves.
Zhang Guangshan has decided to end the Uighurs.
He sent a note saying that Tudun was carrying supplies for the rebels to drop the cagan and better than Tudun to kill, and he got permission and sent a small official to rudely treat Tuduna.
Tudun beat the official with a whip, and Zhang's troops grabbed the Uighur and executed everyone, but one was sent to tell the kagan that Tudun was a rebel, and all the property was confiscated and the girls were returned to the capital.
Treaty of 788
In 783 Dunmaga asked for peace and kinship, Tan Dai-Zun anticipated a deterioration in his relationship with the Uighurs and refused to give to the Princess.
He said, "O my lord, I have a new covenant with the emperor, and the Uighurs have accepted it."
The conditions were as follows:
Kagan is the emperor's vassal.
The Uighur Embassy is no more than 200 people.
China doesn't buy more than 1,000 Uighura horses for silk. They don't take people out of China.
The yellow Uighurs (yugur, yogur; whale, pinging Y, g, Zú; sar.-jug. Sarøg Yogür [sar, j,r], and wide.-south, are one of the 56 officially recognized peoples of China.

History and currentity
Soviet soldiers and officers of Kyrgyz nationality reported to their superiors after the Soviet troops entered Heylongjiang in 1945 that there were people among the local population who called themselves Kyrgyz and spoke a language they understood.
In 1952, an article entitled "Ji-er-ji-si Nanjiang Grassland" ("Kyrgyza of the Nanjiang Lugs") was published by Yu Yifu, which contains basic material on history, migration, social and political situation, culture and folk memory, language, economy, traditions and domestic life.

They are believed to be descendants of the Yenisai Kyrgyz[1] who were "stolen" in 1703–1706 from the territory of Hakasia ("the Kyrgyz Land") to Jungaria.
After the destruction of the Jungar sanity, the Qin Empire authorities moved to Manchuria in 1755–1757 ("20–22 years of reign under the motto `Cianlong '").

Origin
The Fuoy Kyrgyz are one of the fragments of the Yenisai Kyrgyz.[1]
It is believed that the Yenisean Kyrgyz were formed as a result of the long interaction of several ethnic groups.
In addition to the Turkish-speaking groups, Mongol, Indo-Iranian, Ugori, Samdian and Katese elements have become members of the Yenisean Kyrgyz.[4]
There is a view that the Dinlins,[5] one of the ancestors of the Yenisian Kyrgyz, and the ancient Kyrgyz themselves, had close ethnic ties with the Mongols.[6]
==History==The Japanese scientist Masato Suhara (Yap., Qiyan Zhenjen) visited Kyrgyz villages in July 1944, and in May 1945 published an article entitled "Travel to Kyrgyzstan".[12]
It is the language of the Hakasco-Altai group of Turkish languages and is distributed to the PRC.
Unlike the Kyrgyz-Kypchak language, he is a z-language.
He left the main Khakas area in XVII–XVIII ww when his ancestors (Fuyu Kyrgyz) were relocated to Manchuria.

Information
Unlike the Hakash, Shor and Cholymian, the contrast between weak and strong consenters is similar to the Sarag-Yugur language, but different from the last intervocal call -s- and -š-, the preservation of the original -š- and -č-- (in the Saryg-Yugurian predominantly Nogai transitions -š- > -s- and -č- > -š-) and the transition in a number of contexts of the initial j > n ( &lt;?).
It is assumed that he separated himself from the Sagaya or Kachin dialect of the Hakassk in XVIII. Alternative interpretation, based on some of the earlier considerations: close-born Saudi-Yugur language.
Written
The writing based on the Latin alphabet (with the addition of the letters &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot; was developed by the Chinese linguists in the late 2000s, but is not widely distributed.

Kachintsi (Ha &apos; haas, Mr. Haastar) is an ethnographic group in the Haqas.
The speakers of the Kachin dialect of the Hakash language.
A branch of the Hakasian people, with a mixture of Paleosibirians, non-nationals, and Ugro Fin, living on the left bank of Yenisei[1], is located in the steppe part of Hakasia from the superiors of Chulom (Orjonikidzev district of Hakasia) to the river Abakan (Ust-Abakan and Altay regions).
In the 18th century, they lived under Krasnoyarsk, where Kacha still lives.
Therefore, the ethnic "Haash" (Ha'as) can only be linked to the Hakasko-Minusinsk boiler after the 1720-1740 period, following the relocation of the jungle junta by Tsevan Rabdan to the Pryshanje of the Yenishai Kyrgyz, when the majority of the Kachins moved up the Yenisai, to the free lands according to the texts of Iyusa and Abakan.

According to G. F. Miller's testimony, the Russian name "kachi" (or "Kachinese") appeared in the 17th century, with the name of the largest Seok Hashha (Hasha), and the common self-title was the ethnon "yzir".
The Russian form of "cacha" was then adopted by the Hakash population as "Haash" (Ha'as), but already in terms of the general designation of the pastoralists of the Kachin Steppe Duma.
The name "Haash" is characteristic of the ethnic entities and other peoples of South Siberia.
For example: "Haash" is one of the main tofalars, "Haash" is the twin name of the soyots, "Haash" is the dakhat name of the Toji-twins, and "Hara Haash" is the tuba name of the Tofalar.
According to Citaeveda S. E. Yahontha, the ethnic "Haash" is found in the history of "New Tang" in the form of "gaeji".
The Geeji people were living near the oak tribe within Eastern Sayan, where the inhabitants have retained their original name.
The Saghai and the Kyzyls considered the Kachins to be from Torbet, i.e. Derbets from North-West Mongolia.
According to tradition, the Mongolian Khan gave one of his tribes to a daughter who married the Kyrgyz Prince Ozhen-Run.
The latest version confirms that part of the jungle (Derbat) has been relocated to Hakashia.
In 1756, due to the defeat of the Jungar Khan, some 7,000 refugees were settled within Krasnoyarsk and Kuznetz County.
They were part of the local delivery, which had a dramatic impact on their growth (the number of Kachins in the second half of XVIII was 23.5 times higher).
At that time, legends about Shuna Batira and Amour Sanah were spread among the Khakas, and so on with the ethnic name "Yorat" (i.e., the jungle), the tyrate of the Hyrgys, the tyrat of Hasha, etc.
According to the 1837 census, there were about 12,000 Kachins, and in 1926, all but 200 people showed themselves to be hacks.[1]
Sagaytsi (i.e., Sakhai) is an ethnographic group of the Haqas people.

G. I. Spassky also gives a grade:
"Even though they are of the same origin as the Kachins, but in their high school, more than they are similar to the Tatars."
Later in the 19th century, the Sagaeans became belges and considered themselves to be Sagaya Seok.

The versions of the origin of the term "sa'ai" lead to skefo-sarmata time sakes that lived in Central Asia.
History has repeatedly pointed out that the self-name of the Saha yakuts, whose ethnic core has moved from South Siberia to the north, goes back to the root.
In ethnological science, many examples of common features in the spiritual and material culture of the khakas and yakuts have been produced.
A similar ethnonym is known among Kazakhs (sakai, a unit of the Recruited Tribe) and Kirgiz (the Saiak tribe, which is likely to have metesthesis in their name).
The seventeenth century is known for its two branches, Yus-Sagai and Tom-Sagai, which were located at the top of the Jusov and Tommy Rivers.
The Sagays remained out of control of the Russian administration until 1703.
After the transfer of the Yenisai Kyrgyz to Central Asia in 1703, the Saghais in 18th century were a separate Sagai Land.
At that time, small tribal groups from nearby areas were beginning to join the Saga.
Folklore treats the Sagaeans as one of the generations of Yenisean Kyrgyz.
This is also the case in a number of research papers by researchers such as V. V. Radlov, N. F. Katanov, I. P. Kuznetsov-Rasnoyarski and others.
A polar view of the history of the Sagai tribal group is the testimony of the Hakasian ethnographer S. D. Meinagasev, who studied the Haqas people in the early 20th century, who noted that the Sagai did not take themselves out of Kuzneck County, but were considered to be a local Seok (Minagashev, 1914, c.115).
On the other hand, the view of L. P. Potapova, who, on the other hand, as a result of his field studies, pointed out that the Sagaeans were neither a single group nor a single group and were resettled from the Thai areas [See: Potapov, 1947].
P. S. Pallas observed:
Irgith, Irkit (Hak. iprgith, Mong. erkh, erchid, Bur irchid) is a genus of the Hakas ethnic group of the Sagais, as well as of the Alta and Tuvans.
The term "irgith" is found among southern altais, Tuvans, Darhats, drills, soyots.
Ethnonym
In Mongolia there are representatives of the following generations: Archde[11] (irgith)[12] among the Darhats; Architect[11] (irkid), Hasahan Irkid[13] among the Altai Uryanhai.
A part of the Irkit also participated in the formation of the Hubsugul Ukrainians.[11]
In the Hubsugul Haasut hoshun, the genus of the Irkhyat (Irkrit)[14][15] was marked.
Irgiths also live in China.
Irgiths here include the following branches: Ulug Irgith, Bichi Irgith[1][2].

Some researchers believe that the name "jircit" or "erch'd" was created by the addition of an affix-d (-d) to the ancient word "irk".[1]
Irki (n) in the Turkmen language means "national, people".
In Mongolian, the word is known in the form of "irgen" in the meaning of "people, people, citizen".
There is a version of the Tunguso-Manchuran origin of the word "irgen".
Origin
Irgiths were considered in the Khakas to be descendants of the Kyrgyz who lived previously in the uppermost parts of the White Iyus River and on the Wybat River.
On B. Z. Nanzatov, the Irkites are descendants of Sayan Samdians.[5]
According to A. Ochir, the Irkites are descendants of the body's turquoise.
In turn, a version of Mongolian origin has been argued with respect to the body of A. S. Shabalov.
Since ancient times, there has been a genus of irquit (irgid) among the tribes of Tannu-ul and Sayan.
In the eighth to nineteenth centuries, the Irkitas, A. Ochir, were part of the body tribe, which was the main population of the Uighur Haniya.
They've been in a close relationship with the Turks, the Sayans, and the Mongols for a long time.
The Mongols used to call them the Erich and the Erich.
In addition to Mongolia, Irks or erkh'd babies are also recorded in Russia — among the burgers, the altaians, the Twins, and the Hakas.
The spread of births with such a name indicates that once a tribe of erchids was large and numerous, had extensive ties with neighbouring tribes and States, and participated in historical events.[2]
Irks in drills
According to B. Z. Nanzatov, the Irkit and the Archdeith (erhiday) in the drills may be of close origin.
At the same time, the genus of the orchids became part of the bulagats, presumably from the time of the chicken age, while the rickets joined the turrets in the 18th to 19th centuries.[7]
The Irkrit is a member of the Soyots, the Tunkins and the Okini storms[2]; the Bulagatian genus is a member of the Idinian turret[8] (a member of the Idi tribal association of the Olon circus).[9] By number, the erchids included I and II erchids. The genus of the erchids includes the genus Galbantan[10].
Mongolia and China Irkits
The Hakas (Kyrgish) languages are a group of East Türk languages, allegedly established on the basis of the Yenisei-Kyrgish language.
Composition
The initial position uses a j- or explosive sound d'.
Finnish-Kyrgi language
The language is unwritten (Latin writing in writing).
It reflects the characteristics of the language of the Yenisean Kyrgyzes XVI-XVII v.
The initial sound j- can be reflected as n- (soft?).
Traditionally, it is regarded as the closest relative of the Hakasian language and is interpreted as a continuation of the Kachin or Saghai dialect and, according to other information, may be the closest relative, first of all, of Sarag-Yugur.
Hakasco-Altai dialects
There are whistles and boiling dialects.
The Sagai-Beltirsky (Sagay and Beltir) is a district of Ashkiz and Tastyp.
The Sagais-Belterian area is characterized by a coincidence: š > s/z, č > š > s/z (interactively, the primary j > č is usually retained).
Allegedly based on the ancient Kyrgygish Saryg-Yugur, Fuysko-Kyrgyz, Khakas and Shoor and Hakas idioms, which are mutually understood dialects (maximumly separate from the Saudi-Yugurian ones).
Blinking dialects:
Meletsky (comprised of the Central Chulya) is a post in the Pasquet region of Krasnoyarsk province; Kachin (Kachin-Kubaly) in the Ust Abakan, Altay and Shirin districts of Hakasia and Kamasin (Kangalas) in the upper rivers of Mana and Kan of Krasnoyar province; in the Shore-North Altai (Kuznetsk Alatau), in the rivers Kondoma, Mrassu, Tom; in the Tashtypa region of Hakasia, in the Kemerovsky region, in the Republic of Altai; in the Kyzyl-Shirin and Aarhus regions of Hakasia (rivers of Black and White Iyus), in the Ujur and Sharypo regions of Krasnoyarsk province and in the Middle Chulyam (Tutal region) and in the upperch of the Dialksa region, in the Chulym region; and in the Krasnoyarsk region.
The literary form of the Khakas language is based on Sagai-Beltiri and Kachin dialects, and the literary form of the Shore language is based on the Shore dialect of North Altai.
The script for the Hakash language has been known since 1924, a script for the Shore language since 1927, but the first letter for the Shore language was published by missionaries as early as 1885.
Grounds for the stand-alone group
The Hakas (Kyrgi) languages are characterized by the following characteristics:
Reflexation of the Praturk intervocal and final Praturk-d- in the form of -z-; extension of intervocal consents to spirents - and -š- (in this way, they are combined with Southaltai, Northern and Sayan), except in the form of Saryg-Yugur (-s-, -š- > -s-); absence of no loud initial consents, except in the case of Saryg-Yugur and Fuyuys-Kyrgys, as well as Kachin and some others; maintenance in most cases of running and explosive -g.

The Orhono-Enisian pagan (also known as the Orhono-Eniséan pamphlet, an ancient pagan) is a symbol of the language of the Anti-Neurk tribes, which is reflected in the so-called Anti-Neurk Runist monuments.
As a written language, the Archonian language was the next stage in the development of the oral Turkish French language, which, according to the members of the Altai hypothesis, was distinguished from the Altaian French language.
An ancient letter was used to record the language, which was deciphered by Danish linguist V. Tomsen in 1893 and first read by Russian turcologic V. V. Radlov in 1894.
Seven groups of Orkhono-Enisey monuments are known: Lensko-Pribajkal, Yenisai, Mongol, Altay, East Turkestan, Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
According to the S. E. Malov classification, the inscriptions on the Orchon monuments are made in the "Gouzian language".
It can be concluded that either the cucumbers were the people called "the ruling house" by the Chinese as "tuguu", or that the Turk clan spoke the tongue of the Oguz.[1]
Characteristics
For example, the appy of the equivalent -täg has always been deaf, and the suffix of the directional paede - Δaru/gärü - has always been callative. But there have also been direct violations of the rules of dissimulation." A. Musorin, after studying the work of the scientist, stressed the need to distinguish the dissimulation of the radiant and morphological, which was the language used.

The Kyrgyz Kaganat[1] (Uluu Kyrgyz Kaganata) is a state of Yenisai Kyrgyz founded by Barsbek Kaganom[2], which existed between the sixth and third centuries in South Siberia, and expanded to Tian Shani by 840 and lost its independence at various times.
The only people who became Kagan were Bars.
From 840 to 916, the Kyrgyz kaganat was at the peak of its power.
This period is called the academic V. V. Bartold "Kyrgyz great power".[3]
The political-military expansion of the Yenisean Kyrgyz to the west has reached the steppe and forested areas of the south of Western Siberia.
An alien from the heart of Asia appears to have caused the ancient modyar eels from Priurilla to leave, as evidenced by the discovery of archaeologists in the southern Chelyabinsk region (the burial of the so-called "Thuchtyat" culture).
After 80 years, the Kyrgyz Kaganat lost its territories in Mongolia as Bexultan of Mongush gave the rule to his successor, Nursultan.[7] The Yenis Kyrgys retained two major sets of their settlement: (1) Upper and Middle Yenis; (2) Altai and Irtysh; and subsequently the Yenisish Kyrgyzs divided into several branches.
Culture
The service of the "holy state" (Kyrgysian ale) and the ruler was regarded as a great honour for the military.
The ruler held the title of the Cagan.
His wife was a katun.
The emperor was honored by the people as the earthly "prost" of the divine couple Tengri ("The Sky") and Umay, the patron saint of mothers and children.
State-wide manual writing, rising through sogdium to the Middle East alphabetical systems (Armenian, etc.), was a major cultural achievement.
Most of the population was likely settled because a variety of crops were cultivated, such as wheat, proso, yachm, cannabis seed, fruit trees, oats and groves.
Most of the grain was scrapped by hand mills, but there was evidence of a water-intensive, complex mill, and a large irrigation network allowed for good harvests in the dry summer and cold winter.
Sources point out contradictoryly that there were cities in the Kyrgyz Cagant, with very wide trade links, with caravans coming to the kaganat from the cities of East Turkestan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, China and Tibet.
Military
The supreme power of the Cagana was based on a State apparatus based on military power.
A powerful army of ten thousand districts (tummies) was added to the militia in the case of a heavy war.
The knight in the shell of the Yenisai Kyrgyzes, an avalanche armed with a spear, a palash, a battle pillow, or a Czech, was the main strike force of the horse.
The army was run by the Sangoons (generals).
Among the other titles, the army was as many as 100,000 soldiers, including those from the Sassal peoples; 30,000 of them were selected and recruited from the Kyrgyz, and 700,000 were recruited from the kygami (vassal peoples).

For the first time, the term "Kyrgyzstann kaganat" was proposed by the Russian and Soviet East Head, Turcolog, V. V. Bartold.
In the sixth to seventh centuries, the Yenisai Kyrgyzes, with their subservient peoples, formed the peripheral domain of the Central Asian States, headed by a viceroy, Elteber.
At the beginning of the eighth century, local becks and inals, the first of which was Bars-Beck, began a struggle to separate from the kaganate and form their own state, claiming the title of Kagan.
In the 9th century, a rapidly expanding aggressive steppe empire with the deity of the Kagan lineage.
In 840, the State destroyed the Uighur kaganat and extended its power to Tuwa and Mongolia.
In pursuit of the remains of the Uighurs, the Yenisai Kyrgyz fought to Irtysh and Amura, and invaded the oasis of Eastern Turkestan.
This period of history was called "Kyrgyz great power".[4]
The Yenisai Kyrgyz (kit., pygin xiájiás, palp.) is the historical designation of the ancient and medieval Turkic-speaking population of the basin of Yenisé and Altaya[1] (as opposed to the Tiang Shana Kirgis).[2]
Resort to the Yenisai Kyrgyz
The things of ancient Kyrgyz
In the fifth to eighth centuries, the Yenisian Kyrgyz were subordinated to the Jujans, the Turk Cagant, and the Uighur Cagant.
The Uighurs of the Yenisai Kyrgyz were quite numerous: more than 100,000 families and 80,000 warriors.
From the lands of the Yenisai Kyrgyzes to the Uighur Kaghan rate, there were 3,000 or 40 days of journey on camels.[21]
Crushing Uighurs and the bloom of the Yenisai Kyrgyz
In the first half of the 7th century, the Yenisian Kyrgyz became dependent on Suyanto, and the Uighurs appointed a viceroy (kit. ) to supervise them.
The king and his three advisers, however, remained in power: the Cysibaye (kit.,, jiushabobei (kit.,, ), the Amibei (kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.
In 648, Sueiyanto was defeated by the Tang Empire, and many Uighurs became a Thai citizen.
The Yenisai Kyrgyz have decided to send ambassadors to the emperor.
An elder, Silif Shibok Azhan, arrived at the court.
At the feast, he asked the emperor to make him his vassal, and the Emperor ordered that the lands of the elder be taken under the name of the Ziankun governorate (kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yenisai Kyrgyz in the time of Jun
Between 650 and 683 two embassies were sent to China.
From 707 to 710, gifts were sent to Emperor Tang Zhong-Zun, and he mentioned that he was separating Yenisai Kyrgyz from his vassals because of their proximity.[24]
In 758 the Uighurs of Moin-chora won the Yenisian Kyrgyz.
Apparently, the Yenisean Kyrgyz have divided into several princes.
Links were established with the Dasha Arabs (from which the caravans came with smooth tissues), the Tibetan Empire, and with the dwarfs who were used as guides on the caravan tracks.
In 840, they defeated the Uighur kaganat and formed the Kyrgyz kaganat, a former main power in Central Asia, for over 80 years. In about 818, Aghe declared himself a kagan, her mother (who was a turgesi), a hansha widow (who was a daughter of a Tibetan general), a hanshah, and the Uighurs sent an army under the leadership of a minister but failed to win.
In 841, the Emperor of the Tang U-Zun dynasty was visited by the Ambassador of the Yenisai Kyrgyz, who welcomed him very warmly and placed him above the Ambassador of the State of Bohai (Kit. )
Zhao Fang (kit) was on his way to the Kagan with a return visit, and the emperor ordered ministers and officials from the Ritual Order (kit) to question ambassadors and to describe the country of the Yenisai Kyrgyz.
Minister Dae Yu proposed that Age's lineage be compiled and painted.
In 847, the Yenisai Kyrgyz carried out a major march to Amur against up to 500 Uighurs who fled there[25] and took refuge in the Shia tribe, and 70,000 horsemen led by Minister Abo[26] took part in the march.
He died in 847.
The Emperor gave the new kagan the title of Inu Cheng Min Kahan.
In 860–874, the Yenisai Kyrgyz sent ambassadors to Tan three times.
No record was kept after the historians.
Direct connection to Chaatas archaeological culture.
The kaganat subsequently split into several princes, including Juchi in 1207 as part of the Mongol Empire.
There are suggestions that the Tastyk culture and dinlins may be linked to the ethnogenis of the Yenisean Kyrgyz.
In such a case, the first reference to them can be found in the "historical notes" by Sima Qiang, in connection with the submission of their state to the junta (201 B.C.E.),[3] — the Chinese spoke of the State of Jian-kun () (or Jiu-hu, Jie-gu, whose population was considered to be mixed with dinlins.
According to legends, the Yenisai Kyrgyz were ruled by the descendants of the Hong Kong garret prince, Chinese general Li Lin.
The Chinese sources of the period Tang describe the Yenisian Kyrgyz as tall, with red hair, white face, and green or blue eyes.
Chinese sources from the same period indicate that darker and dark-eyed people are present.
An interesting comment on this point was made by Michael Drompp, an American turquologist:
Due to the appearance of the Yenisean Kyrgyz, a number of researchers were inclined to see a non-Jurk, or at least an ethnically mixed, people with a significant non-Jurk component, in the early Kyrgyz.
Many scholars supported this idea, after discovering words that they considered to be non-Jurk (especially Samdian) among the Kyrgyz words preserved in Chinese sources.
It should be noted, however, that the link between language and race is largely unconvincing.
The physical appearance of the Kyrgyz cannot be considered as an indication that they were not türks, just as the lexical appearance of the few may not have been the Turkic words, whose presence can be explained by the usual practice of linguistic borrowing.
The Kyrgyz inscriptions of Yenisei (8th century C.E. and later) are in fact written in fully Turkmen, and Chinese Thai sources clearly say that the written and oral language of the Kyrgyz at that time was identical to that of the Turkish-speaking Uighurs.
Most of the Kyrgyz words preserved in Chinese sources are in fact Kyrgyz.
There's no reason to assume that the Kyrgyz are non-jurisdictional.
References and Internet sources
There is a view that dinlins[7] and ancient Kyrgyz have strong ethnic ties with the Mongols.[8]
According to N. I. Bichirin, the ancient Kyrgyz (Hyagas, Hagas) were of mixed Turkish-Mongoliaan origin:[9] "On the southern edge of the Yenisiah Province, where the capital of the Hiyagas was located, and the indigenous people are now the essence of the Türkongol."[7]
"Hayagas shall initially be a State of Mongolia-Turk and shall consist of two peoples: Turks and Mongols."[7][10][11][12].
However, it is worth acknowledging that this claim is in conflict with a number of contradictions, such as: the European appearance of the Yenisean Kyrgyz,[7] [13], the fully Turkmen language of the Orkhono-Jenisean inscriptions, without any hint of Mongolian influence,[14][15] and the genetic identity of the Yenisean Kyrgyz (Gaplo Group R1a), excluding Mongol origin.[16]
Yenisai Kyrgyzes in Turks and Uighurs
The Turkish Cagant is a major medieval state in Asia, formed by a tribal association of ancient turquoise, headed by rulers from the family of Ashin.
One of the largest nations in history.
During the period of the largest expansion (end of the sixth century), the territories of North-East China (Manchuria), Mongolia, Altai, Eastern Turkestan, Western Turkestan (Median Asia), Kazakhstan, Crimea and North Caucasus were controlled.
==History==In 542 the ethnic "turquoise" first appeared in Chinese sources.
After the death of Buman in 552, his son took over the title of Kara Issik Kagan, who completely defeated the buzz.
After the victory, the kagan dies in mysterious circumstances, and his brother, Mukan-Kagan, heads the State.
In 553 the buzz was broken again, and the turrets became the masters of the entire steppe east of Altai.[3] The following year the turquoise march to the west began, led by the younger brother of Bumana Istemi Kagan.
Ustouni, weakened by buzz raids, did not resist, and as early as 555 the Istemi troops reached the Aral Sea.
However, the har and ephthalite tribes that lived north of Aral were fiercely opposed and were subdued only by 558.
The turks went to Volga's, but they didn't cross her.
Thus, in a short period of time, a huge nomad empire was created, covering territory from Volga to the Hingang Mountains.
Between 561 and 563 the turks entered into an alliance with Iran against the ephthalets.[1][2][10]
In 564, Shah Khosrov Anushirwan's troops occupied a strategic area, Toharistan.
==History==The main forces of the ephthalites were smashed by turks in 567 under Buhara.[2] After the conquest of Central Asia, the kaganat began to control much of the Great Silk Road.
It's an image of turquoise from the Mongolian Aymac Zavhan.VI-VIII Vv.
The Turks and Saudians under their authority were interested in direct trade with Byzantium, and Iran prevented it from doing so, and in 568 Istemi-Kagan sent an embassy headed by Sagdian merchant Maniah to Constantinople.
After negotiations with Byzantine Emperor Justin II, a trade and military agreement was signed against Iran.[2][3][4]
Since the conclusion of the Byzantine-Turk Union, Iran has undertaken to pay a tribute of 40,000 gold dinars annually to the Cagant and not to prevent trade.[1]
In 575 Iran and Byzantium joined together against the türks.
In response to this, in 576, the Turkish troops defeated Vizantia, Bospo Kimmerian, and took a triumphant trip to Crimea and the Western Caucasus.
As a result of these conquests, the Kaganate took control of all important parts of the Great Silk Road, which provided the Turkmen nobles with huge profits from the caravan trade.
Kaganata's breakup
However, the power of the Turki Power was soon shaken.
Since the death of Tobo Khan in 581, there has been a weakening of the Turki Kaganata, the main manifestations of which have been the intensification of internecine wars, the exacerbation of social divisions, China &apos; s offensive on the borders of Kaganata, and war with neighbouring countries.
In 603, the Turki Kaganat fell into the Western and Eastern Turki Kaganates.[1][2][3]
State structure
Kagan (khan) is the highest ruling figure in the Cagant, military commander.[1]
The first face after the cag was the abbey.
The heir of the throne was the Tegin.
Other top titles in the Cagant are Shad, Elteber.
Military
Early history
Pleasure stew weapons: bows with arrows, spears, swords, palashes.
Often use horse and horse armor.
The banners of the family of Ashin depict a golden wolf head.
The Kagan Guard of Burya is a wolves. Death in combat was considered the best death for a man.
Culture
According to S. G. Klashtorny, three deities — Tengri, Umay and Uduk Yer-Su — are mentioned in the Orkhonic Roman monuments. A historian, I. V. Stebleva, has proposed that the ancient non-Jewish deities should be placed at the "levels" of Tengri, then Umay, the third level of Yer-Su, and finally the cult of the ancestors.[11] According to S. G. Klashtor, only the Tengri premises under the head of the Pantheon are evidentiary.[12]
Many researchers today tend to believe that the views of the early turks were trichotomical, i.e. they divided macrocosm into the Lower, Upper and Middle Worlds.[13]
According to legend, the family of Ashin came from the juntaian king and the wolf.
They lived in the mountains of Altai, and their number was estimated at several hundred families.
Ashin Axische is believed to have become a sausage of the Jujan Cagana.
In the middle of the fifth century, Ashin settled on the southern side of Altai and began to extract iron for buzz.
Language
An ancient letter (Archno-Enise writing) is a script used in Central Asia for recordings in the 8th - Xth centuries C.E. [19] Ancient writing was used by the literary language (nadial) of the time.[20][21] [22] [23] [24], also referred to as the language of the Orchono-Jenisic inscriptions.[25]
The memorials, written in an ancient letter, mainly epigraphic, a small number of manuscripts, were kept in East Turkestan, were created in those areas of Central and Central Asia and Siberia, Mongolia, where the early Middle Ages had public education in East and Western Turks, Turges, Carluks, Ancient Uighurs, and others.
The period of Turk (555-745) is a fragment of a building from a memorial complex in the Orkhon Valley, Mongolia.

Hongorai (the ancient Kyrgyz people), Hakass Hoorai, and Hogurei, is a early-faedal public education that existed in South Siberia with a historic centre in the Minusin Kotlovina area from the late 14th century to the early 18th century.
The people called the form of government of Hongoraya the word tolai, that is, an ethno-tribal confederation.
The Russians called this territory the land of Kirgiz.
During the run, the "jargucci" ("chargyans" are a judge) were the judges of the customary court.
Chazoolas, i.e. esaula, were responsible for the execution of the princess' orders and the collection of the Albanian.
Each chazool operated approximately 40 yurt, and wooden kirick tags were used to record the size of the collection.
The Kyrgyz also probably had their own writing that was used in the office.
For example, in 1701, when peace was concluded with the Russian kingdom, the Prince formed a treaty "for their Tatar letter".
By the beginning of XVII in the Krasnoyarsk office, there had been a backlog of Kyrgyz "eleven letters written on paper, one letter written on a beret, and a genuine letter to a Russian letter in Krasnoyarsk to no one".[2]
Social structure
The people of the Minusin Kothina were divided into Hasha Soak, White Bone (Kirgis), and Porca Sox, Grey Bone.
Kistima (Kistimner), i.e., assassin tribes and labors, were included in the "sook of juice", each Hongorai ulus owned certain "Kishtim pillows".
The Kishtims had been indebted to livestock, clothing, and goods during the difficult years, and paid religious tributes.
A hostage system was used to collect the kishtims.
If the kittens did not pay the full tribute, their wives and children were taken into bail.
The majority of the population of the Kyrgyz population were harachs or "hulous people".
At times, the teasons took the Kishtims to their hives for work, and in the teahouse farm there were shepherds and hulas, who were called holocausts in Russian documents, mostly of whom were baked poor people.
The teasans were usually travelling along with their relatives and oysters, who were made up of individual princess Aymaquis, also known in Russian sources as ulus.
The Kyrgyz Land traded with Mongolia, China, Buryatia and Middle Asia, and from China silk fabrics, porcelain products, polished dishes and other items were brought to Hongorai from China.
There were caravans from Central Asia in Hongorai, where Bukhar merchants lived regularly.[3]
Military
==History==Hongray's troops were based on a horse, which in the 17th century numbered as many as a thousand horsemen.
They were armed with bows, but in the 17th century in Hongorai they used firearms that were bought from both the jungle and the Russians.
Creation
Until the 14th century, the Minusin boiler was under the control of the Mongolian Empire.
But after the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, the Mongolian empire, torn apart by internecine struggle, lost control of the territory.
At the end of the 14th century, the Kirgis, in their struggle against the Eastern Mongols, joined together with the Oirates, taking the lead.
The leader of the Kyrgyz fog at the Uguechi-Kashka Federation in 1399 gave his tribal union the name Hongor or Hongorai.[1]
References
In the first half of the 17th century, Hongorai became a vascular dependence on the Mongol Altyn Khans.
In 1667, the jungle, led by Senga, invaded Hongoraya territory and defeated the army of Altyn Khan.
From then on, Hongorai became the Vassal of the Jungar Khan.
There was a jungle viceroy assigned to "all Kyrgyz land" on behalf of the jungle Conteisha.
The Jungar viceroy lived in Altyr Ulus.
Its urga was located on the river Nina.
The people of Hongoraya were to pay tribute to the (alban) Jungar Khan and provide him with military assistance.

State structure
A large convention, "Cheon" from all four hives of Honggaray, was held to deal with public affairs.
For example, 700 people attended the 1627 convention.
At this convention, the decisive vote was held by the Kyrgyz princes.
The convention elected a senior "best" prince, who was given the highest authority.
Thus, the government structure of the South Siberian Kyrgyzes was close to an elected monarchy or aristocratic republic.
The Kyrgyz princes, who were in charge of the hives, had the title of "run" (pigler).
They were between 50 and 300 people at different times, and they were related.
Each of them had a sign.
In the 17th century, many run under the influence of the Mongols and the jungle took Mongol titles (Thaisha, Bachshi).
Among the Kyrgyz princes were those who had been exempted from paying the Albanian for special service to the jungle Khans.
They had the title of Tarhan (Targan).

The Chulymian language is common in Central Siberia, north of the Altai Mountains in the Chulym river basin.
All speakers also speak Russian.
The Chulymian language consists of a number of dialects corresponding to the range of host settlement along the Chulym River, mediumchulm (disperse into two Gorovs — Tutsi and Meletian — and distributed in the Teguldet district of the Tomsk region), and lowerchulskim (discussions — Katsik, Kuerik, Yachin, Chibin, Jezhinsk).[5]
Middle Chuly is a dialect -z - and thus belongs to the Haqasian dialects.
Nizhnychulski is a dialect-j-, and is a north-altaian.
The Chulymian language is extinct and is included in the UNESCO Red Book of Disappearing Languages.
He'll probably be extinct in 25 years.
According to the 2010 census, only 44 of the 355 Chileans speak Chulymian.
Written
Before the beginning of the twenty-first century, Culum was one of the unwritten languages.
The language has never been taught.
In the 2000s, a movement for its revival emerged, and the first Russian-Culim dictionary was printed in 2008.[6]
In 2017, using the help of Vasili Gabov, one of the few indigenous Chileans who still remember their mother tongue, a translation of the Gospel from Mark into that language was initiated by the Church of Tom's Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church — the Jéries Alexi Samponov and John Fontos — using the help of Vasily Gabov, one of the few indigenous people who still remember their native language.[7] The translation of the Gospel from Mark into that language, using the Chalum alphabet developed by the teacher of Tom's State Educational University, Valeria Lemsky.[8]
In 2019, a translation of the Gospel from Mark (named "Marcadian Chuckschuts yo yoyyyyyyyyle" ) was published.

Burhanism (South alt. Burcan Aa; self-titled: White Faith (Southern Alt. Akt. ja) and Milk Faith (C.A.A.) and Altai Faith (Altai Aa) are the ethnic religion of Altais, born in Horn Altay in the early 20th century.
The term "burhanism" is derived from the Turk. Birkan ("Bog") or Uig.-mong. burøa, Burhan ("Buddha").[1][2]
In contrast to the shaman's "black" and "blood" faith, the altaics called burhanism "white" and "milky" faith.
Burhanists praised the days of Jungaria, which were seen as the "golden age" of the Altas and sought to revive the order of those times.
Burhanism was a non-violent national political movement.[3][4][2]
The ideas of the Burhanists formed the basis for the creation of the Karakorum-Altai District Authority under the chairmanship of Burhanist, artist G. I. Gurkin[5], and later the Oirot Autonomous Region.
Up to 70% of Altas continue to practice "Altai faith" — Burhanism and other popular spiritual traditions.[6][7]
According to some reports, "the formal emergence of the Burhanism was the altai prayers in the Tereng Valley" in Ust-Kansk Aymaq (now Ust-Kan district of the Republic of Altai) in 1904, in connection with the waiting for the arrival of the prophet Oirot Khan, Envoy Yuch-Kurbustan/Ak Burhan.[13]
The first preachers of burhanism were Chet Chelpanov and his adopted daughter Chugul 40ov.
In 1906, they and a group of other Burhanists were tried but acquitted.[14]
According to unofficial figures, the true leaders of the movement were the Altai Mandi and Argymima Kuljina and the lamaismist label "Ak-emchi" ("Ak-emchi").
The concept and causes of origin
References
There are two main views of the nature of Burhanism among researchers and among the Algerians themselves.[8][9]
Bruhanist authors
The first is Burhanism, which is a reformed altai shamanism as an Altaian version of common tengrianism, without any meaningful influence from other religions.[10][1]
The second is Burhanism, which is an altai form of Buddhistism, a synthesis of altai folk traditions with elements of Tibetan-Mongol Buddhistism (lamaism).[11][2]
The reasons for the emergence and successful spread of burghanism were:
The land crisis in Altai is linked to the active relocation of Russian peasants from European Russia to the 19th century.[12]
Russian authorities &apos; Russian policy.[12]
Relaxation and a crisis of shamanism, which quickly lost supporters under Orthodox missionaries.
Increased rumours in the former territory of the Jungar Khan about the return (rebirth) of the last ruler of Amursana.

Conquerment
The territory of the Seljuk Empire by the time of the death of Melik Shah
At the very beginning of his reign, Melik-shah crushed his Uncle Cawrd's rebellion and executed him, and Melik-shah extended the boundaries of the Seljuk Empire.
Northern Syria and part of Palestine were captured.
Later, in 1074, he decided to move his military forces against Kahanid Khan Shams al-Mulk, the ruler of Samarkand.
The main battle took place near Karsha, and the Han troops were hit headlong by Seljukidas.
They then captured Buhara and Samarkand.
The Seljuqids for a while refrained from major marches, but as early as 1089, a new military campaign was launched that captured Fergan.
The Seljuk Empire has expanded to the borders of Eastern Turkestan.
Construction, arts and science
In addition to military activities, Melikshah was also engaged in the reconstruction of the destroyed and devastated areas of his subjects after the wars and uprisings.
His State was divided into 12 aggressor princes, run by the Seljuk Aristocrats and military commanders.
In order to facilitate communication between his lazy properties, Melik-shah improved roads, he also built public buildings — caravan-sarais — hundreds of mosques, madrasas and palaces were built.
Art and poetry, as well as science, flourished in the court.
At Melik Shah, the calendar was reformed, high schools were established in Herat, Baghdad, and the scientists were given full protection.
Nizam al-Mulk, the alleged author of the tract Siaset-name ("The Book of Government"), was the minister-in-chief of Nizam al-Mulk, while Omar Hayam, Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, was living and doing.
Domestic policy
As orthodox Sunnis, the Sultans pursued Shiites, in particular the Ismailiths of Hassan bin Sabbah.
Sabbah's followers were able to occupy the fortress of Alamut near Kazvin, and the army under the command of Emir Arslan Tasha, sent by Malik Shah, was unable to defeat her.
Gulyam Sultan Kzil Sarug set siege to the Fortress of Dara in Kuhistana, but ceased hostilities in connection with the death of Melik Shah on 19 November 1092, possibly due to poisoning.
Sultan was buried next to his father's grave at Alp Arslan in Merwah.
After Melik's death, a power struggle began between his sons.

Christians made up 72 per cent of the population of Hakkyari (102,000 of the total population of 142,000).
However, the genocide of Assiri and the genocide of Armenians, organized by the Ottoman authorities in 1915-23, completely deprived the indigenous Christian population of the region.
The Kurds began to settle in large numbers.
In 2009, the province had a population of 236,581.
The absolute majority of the population is Kurds, and there are also the Assirians and the Krypto-Armenians.

In the east, Il Hakkyari is bordered by the Iranian province of Western Azerbaijan, and in the south by Iraqi Kurdistan.
Notes
Il Haqyari also borders the Yals Van in the north and Shirnak in the west.
The province has an area of 7,729 km2 and is at an altitude of 1,700 m above sea level.
Hakkyari is a mountainous, deaf area.
More than 30 tops have a height of over 3,000 m. The highest top of Gilo (4,168 m).
Ten per cent of the area is occupied by mountain plateaus, known as Kandil, Shandil, Berchelan and Kanomehan.
History
Hakkyari has been inhabited since ancient times.
This is illustrated by the rock paintings, the time of which is not known.
Until C.E., the territory was composed of Mitanni, Urarta, the Armenian Airarat Kingdom and Great Armenia.
Throughout history, the region has moved from hand to hand many times; from the second half of the ninth century to the first half of the eleventh century, it was part of the restored Armenian kingdom.

Emetology
Mox is the historic (Armenian) name of the city as well as the region of which it was the centre.
Mox or Mogk on West Armenian dialects literally means "magic spot".
This is due to the fact that the Armenian monastery Surb Amenapkić (Sv.
A savior, in which, according to popular traditions, the grave of a certain Gaspar was found, with many wonderful acts (which were associated with magic in the people's Folklore).
However, since the Urart period, the province of Mox (one of the 15 provinces of historic Armenia) has been known as Hubushkia, but is inhabited by the proto-Armenian Moxena tribe.
After the Armenian genocide in 1915-23, Mox was renamed Mükyus (Turkey's transcript of the Armenian name), then Bakhchesarai (Paradise Palace), since the city was surrounded by gardens.
History
The city of Mox was the center of the same-named province of historic Armenia until its last division between Percy and Byzantium.
Mox was in Mogk-Arandznyak's gawara in the middle of the province of Mox.
The city was the residence of the Armenian Naharars of Moxa.
From the 9th to the 11th century, he was a member of the Armenian Vaspurakan Prince of Arzruni.
In subsequent historical periods, a beautiful city became a rural-type village.
In 1880, there were 18,575 Armenians (more than 86 per cent of the local population) in Moxa.
This ethnic Armenian region did not undergo major ethnographic changes until the spring of 1915, when 95 per cent of the Armenian population was destroyed during the genocide by Turks, either in their homes, or in death marches on their way to the Syrian desert.
Notes
Tubalara (samonage tuba, outdated name of Tuvinese) is an indigenous, small, Turkish-speaking people living in the northern part of the Republic of Altai of the Russian Federation.
The name of the tuba (tuba) is squid, tubalara, and yysh kyi (forest people).
The Tubalars live east of Katuni, along the Bya River, and along the shores of the Teletsk Lake.
During Siberia's training, Russian pioneers called them "black Tatars".
Census
The censuses of the population of the Soviet period (except in 1926) included Tubalars as part of the Alta population.
In 2000, Tubalara were classified as indigenous small peoples of the Russian Federation (Government Decision No. 255 of 24 March 2000).
The 2002 All-Russian Population Census took them into account by a separate ethnic group with its own language, and the 2010 All-Russian Population Census was a sub-ethnos of the Altas.
Number and settlement
According to the 2002 census, the number of Tubalars in the Russian Federation was 1,565, including 1,533 in the Republic of Altai, mainly in the Choy district.
According to the 2010 census, there were 1,965 people, of whom 1,891 were in the Republic of Altai.
Tubalar population in 2002[12]:
Republic of Altai:
Yogach village: 220;
Kebesen village: 198;
Toula village: 135;
City of Gorno Altaisk: 117;
Old Kebesen village: 111;
Tubalar settlement
Artybash village: 108
Language
The Toubalar language refers to a discussion group of either the northern-altai language group or the Kyrgyz-Kypchak (Hakasian) subgroup of the Kipchak group (Turk branch of the Altay language family).
The Tubalars and the Toubalar language are officially recognized as separate people and language, however, the new classification of ethnographers tends to refer to them as part of the North-Altai (Kumandin-Human) language (like the Toubalar language) or as part of the South-Altai (owner of the Altai language).

By the 1980s, Tubalars were settled as follows:

Toubalars belong to the northern altais, but live on the border with the altais of the South and have taken many elements of language, culture and welfare from them.
This was also facilitated by mixing with the Cubans and the chunks.
In the form of Tubalars, European features prevail, and the Mongoloidity of anthropological signs is much weaker.
It's not uncommon to be blonde and light-eyed.
The main Y chromosomal haplas group for Tubalars is R1a1, about 50%.[3]
Origin
There are several points of view regarding the origin of the Tubalars.
For example, V. I. Verbitsky considered them to be a tribe of "disputable origin", stating that "the language and belief of them are similar to that of the Altai Kalms, so one might think that they are a Mongolian root.
But they may well have associated themselves with the people of Mongol."
The opinion of V. V. Radlov, who first drew attention to what the Algerians call "black Tatars" the ethnonym of "tuba", was the most popular.
Gregory Ivánovich Gurkin (12 (24) January 1870, Ulala[1] – 11 October 1937, also known as Choros-Gurkin[1], was a Russian and Soviet painter, a student of I. I. Shishkin.
It is a television station and a member of the Charos.
Participation in events 1917-1920
On 12 May 1917, he delivered a presentation on Altay and his needs in Tomsk at the first session of the National Assembly and made a statement on the allocation of Altais to a separate county.
By that time, he had already been a supporter of Burhanism, the altai religious and political movement.[4]
The first session of the Tomsk Reuben Assembly made its decision in favour of foreigners, granting them the right to self-determination.
The decisive word was made by Gregory Potanin: as a scientist and politician, he pursued one goal: the unification of the body's people into the autonomous Republic of Altai, made up of the Russian State — the Russian Altai, the land of the Minusin natives, Uryanhai, Mongolian Altai and Jungariya (Chinese Altai).
The issue was first discussed at the said Constituent Convention on 22 February 1918, where it was decided that the land once part of the Oirot State would be merged into a separate republic.
An important period of Gurkin's life and creativity (1917–1937) is linked to the events of the revolution, the Civil War, and the establishment of Soviet power in Siberia.
In 1917, a public entity of the Altas, the Karakorum-Altay District Law, was created in the wake of the revolution, and the artist, as the most famous member of the indigenous nation, was persuaded to lead.
As early as April 1919, the Kolchakovs arrested the failed leader of "Separatism and treason of the Motherland" and sent him to Biysk prison.
Gurkin, who was released on bail (in his administrative activities did not find any "practices", hid his paintings and moved to Mongolia with his family and moved to Tuwa in 1920.
In 1925, the artist was persuaded to return to Soviet Russia.
The reception was first a delight, with Gurkin having two exhibitions in Novosibirsk (then the administrative center of Western Siberia), and in 1926 in Moscow, where Lunacharsky joined the choir of admired personal talents.
Biography
In 1937, Gurkin was arrested and shot on charges of organizing an underground nationalist group and spying for Japan.
Rehabilitated posthumously in 1956.
Gregory Ivanovich Gurkin was born on January 12, 1870, in the village of Ulala, in a baptised family.
In 1878, he was assigned to the Iconography Class of the Altai Spiritual Mission School.

After graduating from missionary school, he worked as a teacher for a while, but for a long time he turned to iconic writing.
In 1896, Gurkin met A. V. Anokhin, the collector of the Altay folks, who opened up the world of modern painting to a young artist.
G. I. Gurkin, "The Night of the Victim" (1897)
The first painting, "The Night of the Victim", with which Gurkin unsuccessfully tried to enter the Peterburg Academy of Arts, is full of mystery and naivety.
Orthodox by birth and by upbringing, the artist had a very vague idea of the existence and religion of the Altas, and only later, during the years of creative dawn, did the author seriously study the altai world, leaving thousands of drawings, perhaps not so much artistic as ethnography and religious values.
The work of Gurkin was noticed by I. I. Shishkin, who invited a young artist to live and study.
He's the one who made the Academy a free listener.
In Shishkin, Grigory Gurkin studied for six months — in front of Gurkin, he died quickly, working for his molar.
After the death of the teacher, Gurkin went to Altai, but a few months later he returned to the Academy and studied with A. A. Kiselev, in whose class he was a free listener.
The Matthews discovered his true calling — the landscape.
After a short period of imprinting, the artist took his own path, and in 1903–1905 he wrote a series of paintings characterizing a mature master.
In 1903, the artist returned to Altai and settled in the village of Anos, worked as a teacher, and married.
Gagausia
In view of the fact that no historical documents dating back to the nineteenth century have been found to date to mention the name of the Gagauz people, the history of the Gagauz is still a subject of controversy among historians.
The main assumptions are as follows:
The 13th century (1259–1320) was a period of Christianization of the ancestors of the Gagaus on the Balkan peninsula, which was possible mainly as a result of years of missionary activity by the legendary Sarah Saltyk, who in various Balkan legends is identified with Christian holy ones such as St. George, St. Elijah, the Holy Father Nikolai, St. Simeon, St. Naum, or the Holy Spirit.
The 14th century (1320 - 1347) was an independent Bulgarian Carvunian prince led by a Turkish-speaking Christian of Kypchak origin, Balyk Bay.
Karvunum Terra (Karvunum Terra) was located in the north-east of today's Bulgaria, with a center in Carvuna.
The 14th century (1347–1400) is a gagauze in the independent Bulgarian Dobrujan Crown under the leadership of Dobrich (son of Balyka), followed by Ivanko (son of Dobrica) since 1386.
Dobruja is now a geographical region of north-eastern Bulgaria and south-eastern Romania.
The XIVth century (1400–1812) was a gagauze inside the Ottoman Empire, in the same Dobruje, whose territory is mentioned in the Ottoman historical documents as Uz Eileti, which means "the province of the people of the bonds".
According to population statistics within the Ottoman Empire dating from 1597, Varna lived:
The Gagauzlar (Gagauzlar) is a people of the Balkans.
The modern territory of the compact residence of the Gagauz is concentrated mainly in Bessarabia (south of Moldova and Odessa region of Ukraine).
A small number also live in Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and other countries.
The total number of modern gagauz is about 250,000.
Religion: - Orthodoxy.
Moldova has an autonomous territorial entity, Gagauzia, with a capital in the city of Komrat.
Christians have 582 houses, Muslims have 410 houses, Greeks 120 houses, and Copts 31 houses.
The 19th century (1812–1917) was an emigrating gagause in the Russian Empire on the territory of Bessarabia.
January 1906, in Bessarabia, an independent Komrat Republic was proclaimed to exist for five days.
In 1918–1940, Gagauses entered Romania as a result of the association of Bessarabia with Romania.
In August 1940, the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) was formed from the Moldovan ASSR.
Most of the gagauz were in its territory.
Origin
Language
The Gagauz language belongs to the Oguz subgroup of the south-west branch of the Turkmen languages.
The Gagauz language has two dialects, the Chayarlung-Comrat (central) and the Vulcanest (southern).
The ancestors of the Gagauz are the Turkish-speaking peoples: the goose, the liver, the Kumana; the Seljuk theory is common in Turkey: the Gagauza are descendants of the 13th century Selju Turks who moved to Dobruju and founded there together with the men of the Oguz Power;[8] the most common hypothesis in Bulgaria is that the Gagauzas are descendants of the natural Bulgarians[9][10][8]; the Gagauza are descendants of the turque-bulgar who moved in the 7th century from the Volga coast to the Balkans and took Christianity in the 9th century.
There are no similar linguistic justifications.
It is most likely that all the above-mentioned groups participated in the ethnogenis of the Gagauz people.[8]
Genetic origin
See also
A recent study of the genetic component, conducted with gagauses from different localities, did not clarify their origins.
Researchers have noted that genetic gagauses are highly variable.
In one sample, the Gagauz found Balkan roots, in other Turkic (Seljuk) [11][12].
It's also visible in the outer, physical features of the gagauz.
Gagauses belong to Y-DNC haplas: I2 (23.6%), R1a (19.1%), G (13.5%), R1b (12.4%), E1b1a (11.1%), J2 (5.6%) and N (2.2%).
A detailed study of the haplotypes revealed some links between the Gagauz and Turkish branches, giving some evidence of the Seljuk [11] hypothesis.

Oguz participated in the ethnogenis of modern Turkish-speaking peoples: Turkmen, Syrian Turkmen, Iraqi Turkmen, Croat Uzbeks, Anatolian Turks, Meskhetian Turks, Turkish Cypriots, Gagauz, Salarov and Azerbaijanis.[7]
The infiltration of cucumbers (Seljukov) into Eastern Zakawkaziya and North-West Iran from the nineteenth to third centuries has led to the juration of a large proportion of the local population, which has led to the emergence of the Azerbaijani people.[7]
Emetology
The etymology of the goose is highly controversial.
Some researchers extract "hoos" from "ox", which means "guns" (as well as "flames") and "us" means "multiple suffix." That is, "guns, multiple arrows".
It's a little changed from "a'ah'uh" to "a'ah's father's tribe," like "a'ah's woo," the father's son.
Others make up the word from "ac" — "white" in the sense of noble and "us" — an ancient notion, perhaps translated into "human" or "human" and often duplicated the notion of "ir" or "er", that is, "human", "man" used by different Turkic tribes themselves or in combination with other words, as a self-title.[8]
Origin
S.P. Tolstoy identifies the ancient massagete tribe of "Augas" with the ethnonym "goose", and in the ethnogenesis of the cucumbers, in addition to the Augusto-massagetes, notes the participation of the Huno-Eftalite, Toharo-ass and Finno-Horna tribes.[9]

Jabgu is the title of ruler.
Power was transferred by inheritance.

The Afshars moved from Central Asia to the Foreman Asia in the XIIIth to the XIVth centuries.[23]

Qarapaqlar — literally "black popes"; "terekemie"; "ta·ra·kaʹma"[1]) are a Turkish-speaking people[3] [4] [5] [6] or tribe[1], one from an ethnography group of Azerbaijanis[7][8][9] [10][10][12] living in north-eastern Turkey and north-west Iran[1], as well as in Georgia (Kwemo Cartle) and Azerbaijan (mainly in the Gaza[9] and Agstafin regions).
Until the second quarter of the 19th century, the progeny was divided between the Aru and Gru and the Azeri by the Sevan.
In 1814, the last Erivan Sardar, Hussein Khan Kajar, moved a part of the kapapach to the Erivani area.[18]
In the territory of the Erivan Khan, the Karapakha lived in 28 villages of the Darachichaga Magala.[19]
Cavalryists from the Hamidiye cavalry regiment in Capepah
In 1886, there were 24,000 carapachs in the Caucasus, all in Kars province[21], formed in 1878 from the lands of Kars and the Childir Sandzhaks of the Ottoman Empire, which came to Russia as a result of the Russian-Turkeyn war of 1877-1878.
The encyclopedic dictionary of Brokgauza and Efron, published at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, refers to the Carapachs as a separate ethnic group,[22] but indicates that the Capapachs are "named Zakawa Tartars (i.e. Azerbaijanis - Prim) who have moved to the Kars region from the border extremities of the Caucasus".[23]
In the first general census of the Russian Empire in 1897, "Karapaksky" was listed as a separate language.[28]
According to the 1926 census, 6311 people in the Armenian SSR identified themselves as kapapachs.[29]
In Armenia, the kapapachs lived in the Agbabin district.
In 1944, the Capapachs were deported to Middle Asia along with Meskhetians.[30]
Among the Kapapahs are tribes: tercawyun (otherly known as the Borchalo, considered to be the "Khan tribe"), baral, araplas, jian-hamedi, chaharla, plaque.[13]
Notes
They speak Azerbaijani dialects.[14]
In the Turkish censuses of 1935 and 1950, the carapahi, along with the Turks and Turkmens, were listed as speaking Turkish.[15]
Islam is spoken.
Iranian kapakhas are mainly Shia (mainly Alevites[1]), Turkish are Sunnis.[1]
The Karapapachs, who live in the Gaza and Agstafin regions, profess Sunni Islam, as well as the Borchalyan Kapapahs.
Name
The word "karapahi" literally means "black popes".
The name "karapahi" is often used as the same name as "terecheme".
With regard to these terms, the term "terekemie" in Baskakov is the collective name given by the Persians and is an Arab multiple number ( &quot;, &quot;, &quot; ) from the word "turque" ( &quot;, &quot;, &quot; ).[16]
The name Karapapach, in turn, is a nickname given by the Turks to nomadic tribes, most likely because of the characteristic nature of the clothing ( &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;,, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;,, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot;, &quot; ).
According to Turkish scientist A. Jafferoglu, the quadrant in Turkey is more commonly referred to as the sedentary terekemia in the Kars and Ahiska area, and the name "terekemie" is reserved for nomads.[16]
A part of the kapapach was called a "carabirk".
The Carabers are known to have lived in Shirwan in the 16th century.[17] (There is a village called Karaberk in the current Ujar district of Azerbaijan; under the name of Karabörk in the Kyrgyz era, Manas is also known to be a rich girl, daughter of Kalmian Prince Kayap Dana; it is also one of the tribes that played a role in forming the Karakalpak people.
The Karapapach troops took an active part in the 1826 - 1828 Russian - Persian War. After the war, the eight hundred families living in the area of Lake Sevan moved to Percy and the Ottoman Empire.[20]
The Persian Shah have given them land on the southern coast of Lake Rezaye.[2]
Here, the kapapach mushas were with the co-hosting Kurds of the tribe of ma's ma'ams, mastering the eles of the Kurdish cult.[1]
In Turkey, the kapaks received land in the Kars area.[1]

The territory of the Kalmutsk births in the Kalmysk Haniya (Russia) and the Qin Empire was divided into Aymaki.
In the 18th century, the bashkir was divided into Aymaki, as P. I. Rychkov cited in his book The Topography of Orenburg in 1762.
The modern regions of the Republic of Buryatia were called Aymaks from 1917 to 1977.[1]
From 1922 to 1963, the Aymaks were named as areas of the Gorno-Altai AO.
Modernity

Notes
Hakaska performs a ritual "feeding" of the Ocne sculpture, whose honor is linked to the cult of Umay
Umai (Humai, Umaya, and sometimes Umaya) is the oldest female deity of the Turkish and Mongolian peoples, second after Tengri.
Today's peoples are known in Alta, Baskir, drilling, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Mongols, Tartar, Khakas, and others.
The oldest mention of a god is known in an ancient letter.
In Hakasia, the word Umei (Umai), besides the goddess, was also called the soul of the child from birth to the moment he started walking.
Some of the children's condition was linked to Umay's actions.
If a child smiles in a dream, it means that he's being spoken to by Umei, if he's crying, it means he's scared by evil spirits, and Umay's out for a while. The baby's disease is a sure sign of Umay's absence.
In this case, the shaman was approached to see if his soul had been stolen by an evil spirit because it threatened to kill the child.

Umay is a particularly distinguished earthly female deity, a kind spirit, a patron of children and mothers.
Before giving birth, guarding the baby and the baby, Umay was located at the entrance on the left side of the yurt, which was considered clean.
The image of the female beginning was also reflected in the name of Umay, which meant the mother's womb, uterus, and even a severed umbilical cord.
In honor of Umay, in the front corner of the yurts were suspended along with other images of a doll made of blue matter fed by cough if the child became ill.
She was under special protection for newborns and children of lunatic age, who she rocked and then kept the child up to six years of age until he was back on his feet.
The child's life and health depended on her because she protected her from evil forces and spirits.

The colour of the sky on the flag symbolizes the origin of Turk, red is the blood of the fallen, white is the universal human value.
In 1337, Syrian Turkmen created the Dulkadidov Bailick in Syria.
In 1516, in the Battle of Marge Dabik, Osmana smashed the Mamluks, and Ottoman power was established in that territory for 400 years.
The local population, however, was strongly influenced by Turkmen culture.
Up until the end of World War I in 1914, under the Ottoman sovereignty, Syria developed under the cultural, social, and economic influence of the turquoise.
Since 1936, Syrian Turkmens have been banned from speaking their mother tongue and publishing literature in their mother tongue.
The Turkmen minority, which was deprived of all cultural rights, was also deprived of the right to education in Turkmen.
Syrian Turkmens were prohibited from forming clubs and parties, and from forming associations to cast their votes.
But during the Bashar al-Assad period, significant easing was made in the area of fundamental rights and the independent development of Syrian Turkmens.
The situation of Syrian Turkmens today
Syrian Turkmens are currently predominantly resident in Latakia Province and Aleppo Province.[9]
Since the outbreak of the Civil War in Syria, their representatives have fought against the central government in Damascus.[10]
In 2011, the &quot; Syrian Turkmen Movement &quot; was established in Turkey, and a year later, the &quot; Syrian Turkmen Platform &quot;, which is supported by the official Turkish authorities,[11] Syrian Turkmen armed forces known as the &quot; Syrian Turkman Brigade &quot;, the &quot; Jabada Jabal al-Turkman &quot; (connected to Al-Qaida through the Al-Nusrah Front)[source not specified 870 days] and the &quot; Sultan Selim Brigade &quot; [12]
In the spring of 2014, Turkmen armed groups took part in the capture of the town of Kesab in northern Syria[13]
Language
Syrian Turkmens are using a group of dialects that form a special dialectic zone within the Oguz group of Turkian languages.
Details of Syrian-Turkmen dialects are not available on their grammatical, atmospheric and lexical characteristics and the number of their carriers.

Syrian Turkmens or Syrian turks or Syrian Turkons (Turaye Türkmenleri, Sürye Türkleri) are a people living in modern Syria.
There are about 100,000 Syrian Turks (Turkman, Turkoman) living in the territory of modern Syria.
Anthropologically, it is a European race.
The appearance of türks on the lands of modern Syria
The first was the Turkmen branch of the goose.
The arrival of Turkmens in Syria took place before the 11th century.
Their relocation has increased since the battle between the villagers and the Gazneids at Dandanakan.
Since then, the cities of Tripoli, Damascus, Latakia, Halebe, Hame, Homs and Quneitra have taken full control of Syria.
In 1072, the Seljuk Sultan Melik Shah, using Turkmen militia, captured Northern Syria and part of Palestine [8].
The Oguz Aymaqui Yiva, Boyu, Bayat, Awshar, Beydilly, Ducker and Uchek were located in Damascus and Halab.
These tribes, united by Salah Al-Din in the 12th century, made a great contribution to protecting the entire region from the crusaders.
In the middle of the 13th century, the State of Mamlukov established its authority in that territory.
Owing to the defeat of the Konese Sultan by the Mongols at Kösa Dag, the turquoise living in the area of Sivas and Kaiseri moved to Syria.
During the Ottoman Empire, they went to the territory of modern Syria, namely the cities of Aleppo (Haleb), Hama, Latakia, Homs and their regions, to defend the interests of the Turkish pilgrims who, according to the Muslim canons, carried out the Hajj every year.
Since then, they have settled in these cities and, following the French occupation, some of them have moved to Damascus, where they have been assimilated and have become part of the Arab people.

History
It was carried out in the steppe areas of Hakassia.
At the end of May-early June, after the slaughtering of herders from winter to summer, the first iran was celebrated.
The wintering cattle were cured on the first green feed and the first dairy products were introduced.
Tun Piram (speakly the "first, first - century festival") was linked to the respect for herding — the foundation of traditional farming.
For him, the first dairy products were prepared, the first iran was produced, and new national dresses were made.
The first Araka was driven out of the Iran.
On a certain day, the inhabitants of several Aals gathered in the morning at the nearest mountain summit or in the steppes, where birches were installed, the knights for the ritual horse (Haqaxasian — outcast) and a big fire was built.
And he and those who gathered together passed them through the sun nine times, and hastened the fire, and blessed the heavens and the earth, and desired that cattle and dairy products should not be transferred among the herders.
The first aniran and the first arak were considered drug drinks.
They could not be spilled on the ground.
As is customary, all prepared milk food must be eaten during the festival, and it was forbidden to leave it the following day.
After the ritual part, there were competitions: running, horse racing, shooting from onions, traditional wrestling (kures), and the Hakas fought under the bushes, and the fighters had to hold on to the bushes and throw the rival onto the ground.

The exact meaning of the name and the technology of cooking varies slightly from language to language and from nation to nation, but the general point is that it is a dairy product derived from breast-oxidized bacteria.
In the case of settled peoples, it is liquid and good for thirst, while in the case of nomadic people it is thick as liquid butter, which is very convenient for storage and transportation.
However, in order to satisfy the thirst of a thick airan, dilution of water, milk or cuisine is required (the diluted version in nomads is called suusab/chalap/shalap).
Has different fat levels (see illustrations).
Composition and microbiology
The traditional airan is made of cow's milk with water and salt.
The cow is sometimes replaced by goats or sheep's milk.
It is produced by Streptocococcus thermophylus.
Iran typically contains 94% water, 1.2% to 1.5% fat, 1.7% protein, and 0.75% milk acid.
The Bulgarian airan has higher acidity, up to 1.16%.[5]
The original leaven is the niece of a murdered newborn calf.
That's why they're salting and drying up.
Once the iran is received, it becomes possible to use the already-received iran as a leaven.
Iran is a low calorie drink, and its calories range from 25 to 60 kilocalories per 100 grams depending on fat.[6]
Iran is with the settled peoples
A special feature of the drink is that when it is cooked, skating is mixed with cold boiling water, spring water, or mineral water, with the addition of pieces of ice.
The best is an airan, where water is no more than 1/3 and ice is just less than 1/10 of the total skating or compact.
Iran in Travellers

Iran is given by the abandonment of milk, which in the Middle Ages was poured into a saddle-clothed leather burger with an Ecclesiastical, and in the modern version, the milk is put in a warm place after the addition of the leaven.
To reduce hunger, the airan is used as a food, and the thirst is mixed with water, or with food, or with milk.
The airan also produces a narrow product by removing the serum; in turn, by adding salt and drying to the shadows, the chicken is made from the narrow.

There are two versions about the origin of the urums.
According to the first version, the urums were in the rezulta if they were in the Crimean language (in terms of an odd of gipospos, the Turk language was absorbed by the ma'alo-azi rhymes that were in Crimea).
According to the other, the urums came into existence at the end of the day by the fact that the Crimean tha·tar hrʹstiʹta was a party[2].
Ethnonym
The term "urum" is derived from the Arabic word "Rum" meaning "Rimlian, Roman", followed by "Visantian" (East Roman) and "Great".
The words beginning with the "r" were unusual for the Turkmen languages, so in order to facilitate the pronunciation, the speakers added a vowel to the beginning of the word.
However, in modern Turkish, the writing "urum" is considered obsolete even though it continues to be used; the writing "rum" is used as a literary form.
Prizon urums
Historically, the Greeks of Crimea (and later the adjacent Priaziah; the Sovr. Donetsk region of Ukraine) were represented by two groups:
Ellinic rumes and turquophone urums.
Both groups have settled the region for centuries (they were made up of descendants of Greek colonists from the fourth century B.C.E. to the fourth century C.E., as well as those who immigrated from Anatolia individually at different times), but the latter have gone through a series of social and cultural perpetitions that have made their mother tongue a Turkmen.
Some researchers, however, are convinced that the indigenous Christian population of Prizozia, primarily Greeks, Goths and Alans, played a certain, if not almost exclusive, role in the ethnogenis of the Urum.
The Prizorian Urums profess Orthodoxy.
Throughout their ethnic history, they have been an isolated group, and they have not settled in populated areas.[3] In 1969, it was estimated that there were 60,000 Uruma carriers living in Ukraine.
According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, of the 77,516 Greeks in Donetsk province, 70,373 indicated Russian as their mother tongue, 2502 as Ukrainian and 4,153 as their "language of nationality".[4]

The Uruma language is close to Crimean-Tatar.
It is likely to be based on the language of the male (Kumans, Kypchakov), the main core of the tribe union that emerged in Eastern Europe in the mid-th century, occupying a vast area in the east (Dest-i-Kypčak) and the west (Chernomorian steppes and later Crimea and part of the Balkan peninsula).
There is no single classification of the dialectic composition of the Uruma language due to a lack of study.
S. N. Muratov identifies three dialects:[3]
Kypchak (Beshew, Janisol and Mangush); Oguz (Mariupol and Old-Rokram talks); medium, which singles out the gourmet with a slight Oguz influence (Bogoy, Kermenchik, Ulaklinsk) and the gourmet with a greater gourmet influence (Ignatiev, karan, Comar, Laspinsky).
At the same time, A. N. Garkavec, in the Urumian language, highlights four dialects:[4]
Kopchak-Semi-Shoots (Great Novoselka, Starobeshevo, Mangush); Kopchak-Gowsy (Old Kermenchik, Bogatyr, Ulakla); Goose-Chucks (Caran, Starolaspa, Kamara, Gurji); Oguzh (Mariupol, Old Crimea, Karakuba).
It also highlights the superdialettic tongue of Folklore.
It contains much more lexic and morphological gourmet elements than domestic talking.[1]

Mausolei (cube) Tekturmas (caz.
Tectørmas to the Besca) is an architecture monument located on the south-east edge of Taraza on the right bank of the Talas River on the top of the Tekturmas Hill.
The building and builder of the mausoleum are unknown.
Among the local inhabitants, the mausoleum is considered to be the burial site of the Holy (Auliya) Sultan Mahmud Khan.[1]
In 2001, by the 2000 jubilee of Taraza, a tomb was built at the site of the destroyed mascara on project A. Itinova as part of an individual interpretation of the previous structure, with a significant amount of plastic expression of facades.[1]
Notes
Architecture
The building was extensively destroyed.
In photographs of the 1890s, the mausoleum was a dome, a four-angle plan made of burnt brick.
The corners of the mausoleum ended with pilsters, and there were traces of plaster on the walls.[1]
From the decorative trim of the mausoleum, only one ornamental terracotic tile was found, suggesting that the mausoleum was built in the fifteenth century.[2]
The arch entrance is westward to the city of Tarazu.
History
At the end of the 19th century, the mausoleum was studied by Vasily Callaur, and in 1939-1940 was examined by G. I. Patsevich.[1]
In a timeless necropole surrounding mausoleums, ossoire graves of Zoroastrians were identified for the storage of skeleton remains, medieval burials of Christians and Muslims.[2]
The mausoleum was built on the grave of Sultan Mahmoud-han (Tekturmas-ata), which made a significant contribution to the development of Islam in the region and was honoured as a saint among the local population.[3]
In 1935, the mausoleum was dismantled to the base of bricks for construction purposes.
At the same time, the local inhabitants built a small building near the grave, and continued to worship the zirat.
Mausolei Karahana (Aulie-ata mausoleum) (Caza.
Cesenesi (,,,,, ) is a monument to the architecture of the 11th century in the Kazakh city of Taraz, in the park at the intersection of the streets of Tole Bi and Baizak Batira.

History
Nadgrobier in Karahan mausoleum
According to local oral traditions, the mausoleum was built over the grave of Karahan, the founder of the Karahanid dynasty, who was the first of the türks to adopt Islam.[2]
According to researchers, the mausoleum was built over the grave of a member of the Karahanid Dynasty, Shah Mahmud Bougra Karahana.[3]
The stories and legends recorded about him by Vasily Callaur are well known: "Abdu-r-Rahim-Bab.
His son Sha-Hasan, by Kylyj-Karahan... his son Abdul-Halik-han.
She buried him in Otara, south of the city of Turkestan, and the grave of Aulie-atah, on the Talas River.
Auliya-ata had a second son named Qasim-han-Baba, his grandfather Kyran-sheikh, his brother-in-law Mahmoud-han-sheikh, and his daughter Bibi-aisha, whose grave is two tashas from the mountains.
The mausoleum was not preserved until today in its original form, in 1905 (other data in 1920[5]]) it was destroyed to the ground and rebuilt and, while maintaining the design principle, lost its original architectural and decorative management.[2]
Inside the mausoleum, a step-by-step tombstone remained.[3]
The construction was financed by Ishan Said Bakhanov of Tashkent.[4]
In 2002, the mausoleum was restored by the 2000 anniversary of Taraza.[1]

Salari () () is a Turkish-speaking people in China and descendants of the Turkmen-Salir tribe; they live in the Xinghai Autonomous Region and other areas of Qinghai Province, as well as in Gansu and Xinjiang Provinces.
The population is 104,503 (census, 2000).
Anthropologically, the salares are diverse, but the Mongoloid type prevails.
According to religion, the Sunni Muslims have a small part of Tibetan Buddhistism.
The main traditional activities are herding farming, herding, gardening and gardening, grasshopper and pottery, dominated by small families.
Salari are part of the large ancient and medieval Turkmen Salir tribe, which separated itself from the Seljuks and migrated to the east in the 14th century (formerly, according to tradition, the Salara (salyr, salor, Salgur) lived near Samarkand, and now most of the Salyls live in Turkmenistan, Ahals velayat, Serah Etrape).
The Salari have been involved in popular uprisings on several occasions.
The 1781 uprising is particularly well known when the Salari murides of the founder of the Jahria sect.
Ma Minsin, under the leadership of their Ahoun Su Syshisian (, "Su Forty-three") went to Langzhou in an attempt to release the arrested Ma.
After the execution of Ma Minsin by the Cynic authorities, the Salari rebels laid siege to Langzhou, but after the arrival of the Cync reinforcements, all were beaten.[2]
During the civil war in China, the Salar province was under Ma Bufan's control.
It is said that when the rebellion was repressed and Han Imu was taken to Beijing for trial and execution, he realized that he underestimated the forces of the opposing party and observed: "They have more people in China than in Qinghai Yak!"
Religion
The language of Salár is the Turkmen language of the Oguz group and is common in the Qinghai and Gansu provinces.
The number of hosts is about 60,000.[2]

In the 14th century, the natives of the language moved away from the villagers and migrated to the east (formerly near Samarkand, according to tradition, the Salara lived near Samarkand).
The language is now heavily influenced by Tibetan and Chinese.
The Salar language was first mentioned in XVIII, with its classification as East Türk (in particular in the work of G. N. Potanine, "Tangut-Tibet Margin of China, II").
As a member of the Oguz group, the Salar language detects traces of kapchucka effects, as well as eels with East Türks, in particular, some words show -d instead of -j - as in Sayan (adg 'bear' instead of general aju; Jalaʹdex 'bosonogy' on an equal basis with ajax), the system of consenters contrasts primarily with the strong and weak, as in Sayanian, Sarig-Yugur and Fuyuysko-Kyrgys, rather than deaf and cally.
Written
Salari mainly use Chinese for written purposes, using the Salar language for conversational purposes.
Salarov did not have official writing, but it was sometimes recorded using Arabic writing.[3] There are calls for the standardization of Arabic scripts for the Salar language.
Some Salari require Latin alphabet, and some Salari elders who do not like Latin alphabet want Arabic scripts.
The lack of official writing resulted in the salari using the Chinese writing system.[4][5] China offered salam an official translation system very similar to the Uighur Latin alphabet, but it was rejected for the same reasons as its yezi had been rejected in Xinjiang.
Young Salari have also started using the Salar alphabet, based on orthography for the Turkish languages. There are two main options: TB30 and TB31.
Arabic font also continues to be popular among salaries.
The Arabic script has a historical precedent among the salaries; centuries-old documents in the Salar language were written by the Arab moustache when they were discovered.[6]
The territories inhabited by lawns in Anatolia
After reaching the Balkans in the middle of the 14th century, together with the Ottoman military forces, the Turkish-speaking legal professions settled along the main transport routes (Fraccia, Dobruja, Macedonia).
Many continued to maintain a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle, especially Pinda's Jurücks, who were travelling in the area of modern Kozani, Greece.
In Macedonia, the Jujuks are scattered along the Ridge of Placchic (especially in the villages of Kojalia, Parnalia and Ali Koch) and live in villages near Doyran, Stip and Strumitza.
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was the son of a lawyer from the village of Kochajik (in Western Macedonia) and a salon Albanian.
Because of the fact that the way of life of the legal people was very similar to that of romantic peoples such as Aromons and Megllenrumans, these groups began to get closer.
Part of the Meglenerumin has converted to Islam and was subsequently deported (1923) to Turkey together with the legal community (the Greek-Turkeyn exchange).
In modern Turkey, especially in its underdeveloped, industrially and socially, eastern and south-eastern parts (Tawr mountains, internal Anatolia, Armenian highlands) continue to be dominated by groups of lawyers with a traditional semi-nomadic lifestyle.
The Yuruk diaspora in Macedonia, though settled, preserved many ancient customs.
However, most Macedonian legal officers do not even have a secondary education, and some women speak only Turkish.
Anthropology
A. Ivanovsky found quite visible Mongoloid features in the legal system — the protruding cheekbones, the poor development of the third hair cover, and the 18 people he examined had epicantus.
This weak Mongoloidity dates back to the Turks of the Middle Ages.

Description
According to one version, the word "jury" comes from the Turkish verb "yürümek" (diti, move).
In a narrower historical context, the law is understood to mean groups of nomadic Turkmen tribes of the Oguz group, drawn only from the emerging Turkmen ethnic group and moved westward to Percy, and then to Byzantium, where the invasions of the Seljuk Turks and then the Ottoman Turks led to the disappearance of the Greek (byzantine) statehood.
In their nomadic way of life, the lawns often became Dervishs, preachers of Islam, often combining this function with the role of gas — warriors of the holy war, gasp, against the unbelievers.
However, the women of law never wore burqas.
Lawyer's Legs
The Juruki people have long been divided into a series of fratrias or tribes:
Ak-Sigirli[1], Ali-Efendi (Ali-Efendi), Bakhshish (Bahsys), Chakallar (Cakallar), Choshlu (Cočlu), Kekli (Kekli), Gacar (Gakar), Güzelbeyli (Korzum), Kara-Ewli (Karaevli), Kara-Khachili (Karahachil), Kara-Koyunlu (Karakoyunlu), Kara-Kali (Karakayali), Kara-Lar (Karalar), Kara-Kechili (Karakeçili), Manavli (Manavly), Melemenci (Memenci), San-Agali (San-Agally), San-Khachili (Sanhakzyli), Sara-Okeili (Sarzekei-Oekeli) (Sarzekei-Tekeli)
Settlement
Flag used by Iraqi Turkmens
Iraqi ethnic and religious groups
The number is not known.
Iraq's Turkmen population is estimated at between 500 and 800 thousand, or 2 to 3 per cent of the population (most Western researchers estimate) to be 2-3 million or 7.5 to 11 per cent of the population (as reported by Turkmen organizations).[27]
The Turkmens live mainly in northern Iraq, and the settlement area extends from the border with Iran in the east to the border with Syria in the west.
They live mainly in the cities of Tall Afar, Altinköprü, Erbil, Mosul and Kirkuk.
A large number of Turkmens live in Baghdad, Iraq's capital.[26]
Like Iraqi Arabs, Iraqi Turkmens are religiously divided: more than half of them are Sunnis and the rest are Shia.[1]
Iraqi Turkmen, also Turks, Turkmans (Azerb.
() is an ethnic minority in north-eastern and central Iraq.[4]
They come from the Oguz tribes that settled in the region after the 11th century and are considered to be remnants of Kara-Kyunlu and Ak-Kyunlu Turkmen tribal confederations.
A number of sources classify Iraqi Turkmens as part of Azerbaijani[5][6] or other Turkish-speaking peoples[specify][7][8][9].
The third largest people in Iraq after Arabs and Kurds.

The Syrian Turks are a Turkish Turkmen group in Turkey.
Language
The Iraqi Turkmen language belongs to the Oguz branch of the Turkmen languages and, according to a number of ethnographers and linguists, is a dialect of the Azerbaijani language[10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][9][19][20][21][22].
A Turkish scientist of Iraqi-Turkman origin, Hidayat Kemal Baitlah, wrote: "The talker of Iraqi Turkmens is part of the Azeri-Turk dialect.
Geographically, the azery dialect covers Eastern Anatolia, Southern Caucasus and Caucasus Azerbaijan, Iran Azerbaijan, Kirkuk (Iraq) and the Syrian Turk regions."[18] According to the "Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East", Iraqi Turkmen speak a dialect of Azerbaijani.[23]
A Turkish scientist of Iraqi-Turkman origin, Suphi Saatcha, writes that the oral speech of the Kirkuqians is the motive of the Azerbaijanis and corresponds to it from the lullaby to the riddles and parables.[24]
According to Christian Buluth, the Turkmen language, being an independent language, has both the root elements and the influence of neighbouring Turkish and Azerbaijani languages in its background, language, morphology and syntax.
Traditionally, modern Turkish standards dominate written language.
The spoken language is significantly different from the written language, with the additional influence of the official Arabic language in Iraq, as well as neighbouring Kurdish dialects such as Kurmanji and Sorani.[25]
Most Turkmens speak Arabic, and some become natives, which is indicative of the assimilation and Arabization processes of a certain part of Turkmen.[1]
Number and settlement
Kara &apos;-Kyunlu (Turk. "Chernobaran" in the tungsten signs of Kara-koyun) is an association (tribal confederation) of the Oguzese nomadic tribes led by Shia Turkmen[4][5][3] [7] dynasty from the Oguz genus of Iwe, which existed in the 14th to 15th centuries in the Ford Asia, on the territories of modern Azerbaijan, Armenia, Iraq, north-west Iran and eastern Turkey.[8]
However, the former allies' relationship at that point was once again upset.
Ahmad Sultan, taking advantage of the fact that the Head of State, Ak Koyunlu Osman Kara Yuluk, began a march from Eastern Anatolia to Erzinjan, also opposed Kara Kounlu, which in 1410 was defeated in the Battle of Shanby Ghazan and executed with his sons, and Kara Yusuf became the ruler of Arab Iraq, Armenia and the neighbouring territories of Kara Koinlu, formed in the same year with the capital in Tebriz.
He himself ruled South Azerbaijan, and gave the rest of the land to his sons.
However, the war with Shahruh was quite successful for Kara Yusuf, as was the conquest of Shirwan, whose high priest Ibrahim was captured and finally admitted to being Vassal Kara Kounlu.
The successors to Kara Yusuf were his sons Iskandar Khan (rules 1420-1429 and 1431-1435) and Abu Said Khan (rules 1429-1431), followed by another son, Jahan Shah (rules 1436-1467), who was the first among the rulers of Kara-Kyunlu to take the title of Sultan.
In 1467, in a battle with the ruler of Ak-Kyunlu Uzun-Khasan near the town of Mush in southern Armenia, the Jahan Shah troops were defeated.

The ruling generation came from the Goose family of Iwe, the Baharla,[9] who by the 14th century owned territories north of Lake Wang and in the vicinity of Mosul, in northern Iraq.[10]
Among the tribes of Kara-Kyunlu were Baharlu, Saadlu, Karamanla, Alpaut, Spiritarlu, Jagirlu, Hadjila, Agacheri.
They were driven into Asia by the invasion of the Mongols, leading among them Bacharlu and Saadlu.
The aliens were initially settled on the upper Euphrates and Tigers, where, after the devastating journeys of Chingiz Khan, there was enough room for new residents.[6]
The rulers of Kara-Kyunlu were initially vassals of earlier Turkmen dynasties until Abu Nasr Kara-Muhammad, son of Bayram Hodji-beck (Emir Jalyirid Sheikh Uweis), declared his independence from the Jalyrids in 1382 and concentrated his forces in Tebriz and Eastern Anatolia.
Thus, Kara-Muhamed (1380-1389) was founded by the reign of the Kara-Kyunlu tribal union, which was largely similar to that of the Jalaidids and which maintained traditions and ties dating back to the Chingizid times.[1] Later, he had to face Timur's army, the victory of which forced the Turkmen leader to flee west to the Ottoman ruler, Bayazid.
After Kara-Muhammad, Kara-Kyunlu became the ruler of Kara-Yusuf, who ruled from 1395 to 1403 and from 1406 to 1420.
Following the death of Timur Kara-Yusuf, he opposed his son, Miran Shah, on the side of the old ruler of Arab Iraq and Armenia, Ahmad Sultan (of the Mongolian genus Jalayrid).
Kara Yusuf and Ahmad were initially able to occupy Baghdad, but differences arose between them, and soon Kara Yusuf fled the Timudrids to the State of Mamlukov, but as a result, Miran Shah was broken up in 1408 near the area of Sardud and died and the State of Jalayridov was restored.
Ak-Kyunlu (türk.) is a tribal confederation of the Turkish tribes[6][7] [8] led by the Bayandur tribe, which ruled in eastern Anatolia and western Iran until the Sefeweed conquest in 1501-1503.
In Byzantine sources, this dynasty is called Aspropetatids.
Tribe History
For the first time, the Turkish tribes of Ak-Kyunlu were mentioned in Byzantine chronicles of 1340 when they were travelling in eastern Anatolia.
At that time, many of their chiefs took Byzantine princess wives, including a prominent representative of the Uzun-Hasan dynasty.
By the end of the Ilhanid period in the mid-14th century, the Oguz tribes of Ak-Kyunlu were travelling in summer pastures in Armenia,[2] in particular the upper Tigris River and winter pastures between the cities of Diyarbakir and Oivas.
Since the end of the 14th century, Ak-Kyunlu has been in constant wars with another association of the Oguz nomadic tribes of Kara-Kyunlu.
The leading tribe of Ak-Kyunlu was the Bayandur tribe.[10]
==History==The history of the tribe dates back to Bayandur Khan, the founder of one of the twenty-four gouge tribes, and the grandson of the legendary Oguz Khan.

In the 14th century, there were frequent armed clashes between the troops of the Trapesund Empire and armed Aq-Kyunlu.
It was not until 1352 that the world was concluded. Maria Komnina, the sister of the ruler of Trapezund, Alexey III, was married to Fahr al-ad-Din Kutlu-bei, leader of the Ak-Kyunlu tribe, and their son subsequently married Alexei's daughter.
This marriage ended the frequent raids into the Trapesund Empire by the Aq-Kyunlu gouges and subsequently laid the foundation for the union relations between the two States.
In 1389, power was transferred from Fahr al-Ad-Din Gutlu to his son Ahmed, but due to the latter's recklessness, he was replaced by his brother, Kara Osman.
According to the Encyclopedia of Iran, Kara Osman is the real founder of the State of Ak-Kyunlu.

The Uighur Turfan Idikutty (Idicutism), the Uighur State of Idykut, and the Uighur State of Kocho, are the medieval Turkmen feudal state in northern eastern Turkestan, under the control of the Uighur dynasty, formed as a result of the collapse of the Uighur kaganate.
Turfana was not at war to expand its territory; it sought to maintain peace and non-interference in the affairs of other peoples; military action was carried out mainly against the invaders of the Tangut, as well as the religious opponents of the Karahanid dynasty.
The Uighur Buddhists were attacked by Muslim Turks and described in Kashgari [11]. Mahmoud Kashgari's works contained poems and poems describing the battle between the Uighur Buddhists and the Karahanida Muslims.[12]
Uighur Buddhist temples have been desecrated, Uighur cities have been raided, and the province of Minglak through Ore has sought to conquer the Uighur Buddhist Muslims, as described in the 5th to 6th straff of Kashgary.[13][14][15].
Mongolia's Conquerion
According to Iranian historian Ata Melik Juwayni (XIV V.), the Iranian peoples perceived Uighur writing and language as the highest point of their culture.
Decline
The Uighur Buddhists of Kocho and Turfan were converted to Islam during the gaswat (Sacred War) by Muslim ruler Hizr Hodja, and the Buddhist frescos in the "Save of Thousands of Buddh" Beeklik were damaged by the local Muslim population, whose religion banned images of living creatures, eyes and mouths, among other things, were often handed over.
The pieces of fresco were also broken for use as fertilizer by local residents.[27]
Creation
Idicutes
The territory of Eastern Turkestan was part of the Uighur kaganate until its dissolution in the 840s.
Since the collapse of the kaganata, most Uighur have migrated to various regions of Eastern Turkestan (Turfan, Kumul, Karashar, Kucha, or Kashgar), as well as to Gansu, where they created two States, Idykutty (with a centre in Turfan) and Gansuy (with a centre in Dunhuan).

Alexandra was captured by Crimean Tatars in her hometown and was transferred to Istanbul in 1520, where she found herself in the palace of the young Sultan Suleiman.
By becoming a beloved concubine and later wife of the Sultan, Hurrem neutralizes anyone who can prevent her from pursuing her ambitions in the Sultanate.

Notes
The Karahani State (per. () is a Muslim medieval state in Central Asia.
Islamization of the Karahanid State
According to Ottoman historian Munajim Bashi, he was the first prisoner to convert to Islam, and later in 940 he received a fatwa for the death of his father, who apparently did not want to accept Islam, and after his death Satuk reigns in Kashgar, openly declares his rights to the highest authority and accepts the title of Khan.
Under the son and successor of Satuk (Abd al-Karim), Bograh Khan (920 - 955) (Bogora), a camel, Musa bin Abd al-Karime Bograh-hane (956 - 958), "Islamicization" began in the Khan.
The supreme title of ruler, the Sultan of Al-Salatin (i.e. the sultan over the sultans), was taken from Arabic, but nevertheless, the Turkish titles such as Kagan, Ealek and Tegin did not lose their significance.
During the reign of Musa Suleimane's brother, Bin Abd al-Karime (958–970), who took the title of Arslan Khan, the entire population of the State was converted to Islam, according to the Arab historians Ibn Miskaweikh and Ibn al-Asir in 960, "The 200,000 tents of the unbelievers (Thurks - A. B.) have converted to Islam."
The accession of Maverannahra and the break-up of the Samanid Emirate
State of Karahanids in 1000
The sons of Suleiman Ali (970-998) and Hassan (known in written sources as "Shegab Al-Daula", "The Star of the State") (970-992) have been given dual power in the country.
Ali Ibn Suleiman takes the title "Arslan Khan" in Kashgar, while his younger brother, Hassan bin Suleiman, takes the title "Bogarah Khan" and reigns in Balasgun.
In 992, the brothers decided to join neighbouring regions, in particular Maverannakhr.
However, in 999 and this last bulwark of Samanid's power collapsed under the new Natyan Karanyd troops. Nasr Bin Ali Arslan-han (998–1017), Ali Arslan-han's youngest son, to whom Ali had already bequeathed his throne in his lifetime, took Bukhara, and Abd al-Malik II and other members of the ruling family imprisoned, thus the power of the Samanids collapsed.
Origin
The fragmentation of the State, Alida and Hasanid, the Karahanides' dynasty struggle
In 1040, the Karahanid State collapsed into the Western and Eastern Hanics.
In 1089, the Western Karahanid Khanism became the villager's vassal.
The origin of the dynasty itself is unclear.
As noted by Carahanidov, the largest and most widely recognized historian in the history of Karahanidov, Karahanids themselves identified themselves as descendants of the legendary king of Turan, Afrasiab, and their dynasty was called Al-Afrasiab, the family of Afrasiab, while in handwritten sources they were called Hanidam or Hakanides.[8]
This interpretation of history was also noted by the American historian Robert Dunkoff, who wrote that the Karahanids believed that the real name Afrasibab sounded like Alp Er Tunga.[9]
Its name (Karahanides, less than the Ileks) is perfectly specific and is designed by 19th-century historians of two common titles: Kara-Kagan and Ilek[10].

After the defeat of the Uighur kaganat in 840, an Edgish, a member of the Chigilian tribe, the Karluq Yabga, and the ruler of Isfidjab Bilge-Kul, openly declared his right to power and accepted the title "han"[11][12][13].

In this connection, in 893 the cities of Isfijab and Taraz were taken to the Seven Republic.
After a prolonged siege, these cities fell, and the population was forcibly converted to Islam, and Chigili were forced to move north, near Lake Issyk-Kul, and the Khan was forced to move to Balasgun.
By this time, another tribe of the Carluck Confederation — the lagoon — had been displaced by Tibetans and settled in the same arena.
It is from this moment that the two tribes, which later became the nucleus of the Karahanid State, begin to interact closely.

In 1917, the book was sold at Istanbul's book market to the famous bibliophile Ali Emiri.
Later, Emiri's collection of books, together with Divan, reached the Istanbul Millet General Library, where it is still stored.
World profile and first publications
After K. Rifat first published "Divan Lugat At-Turk" in Istanbul in 1915–1917, the dictionary became famous and attracted great interest in the scientific community.
In 1928, Carl Brockelman created the "Sword of the Middle Turk" on its basis.
In 1939–1941, B. Atalai translated "Divana" into Turkish, and in 1941 he issued a facsimile of manuscripts, and in 1943 he issued an indexed version of it.
In the early 1960s, the work was studied and translated into Uzbek by S. Mutallibov.

Background
In the period leading up to the writing of the book Diwan Lugat al-Turk, the Turkish tribes had achieved unprecedented military and political success in the Muslim world.
At the end of the 10th century, the Karahanids defeated the Samanids and established their power in Central Asia.
In the 11th century, the villagers subjugated their territories from Horasan to the Mediterranean, Asia Minor, and won over the Byzantine.
History of the creation and owner of the manuscript
Al-Kashgary finished writing "Divana" in 1074 (466 Hijre), and the only original manuscript left to date was in 1266 (664 Hijre).
The work was dedicated to the Abbasid califa in Baghdad, and after 1258 it was likely to reach the Mamluks.
The new owner, apparently aware of the importance of studying the Turkmen language, instructed the censuser, Muhammad Bin Abu Bakr Bin Abu Al-Fatha Al-Sawi, to make a copy of the original.
According to the censuser, the work was completed "on the first day of the week of 27 shavwals of 664" (1 August 1266).
According to the cover sheet, between 1400 and 1401 the manuscript owner was Ahmad Khatib Daraya, who lived in Cairo, which some researchers believe is nothing but Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Suleiman Al-Ansari al-Dimashki al-Darani (1344-1407).[1]
In 1422, Badruddin al-Aini used Divana fragments in the first volume of his "Ikd al-Juman fihary al-Zaman".
A comparison between these fragments and the remaining manuscripts revealed that they were fully consistent.
In Istanbul, the Diwan Lugat At-Turk was most likely hit by the fall of the Mamluk State in 1517.
A number of notes and corrections to the book are made during the Ottoman period.
In 1650, Katib Chelebi referred to "Divana" in the bibliographic work "Cashf al-Zunun."
There are no other references to the book until the 20th century.
Mahmoud Ibn al-Hussein Ibn Muhammad Al-Kashgary (Arab, Mahmood, Al-Kashgari, letters, Mahmoud Kashgari; 1028 or 1029, Barshan, on the south-east bank of Lake Issyk-Kul[Kom 2], is an unknown year of death, but some suggest 1101 or 1126, Opal, near Kashgara) is a Turkian philologist and lexicographer.
Born in the Karahanid State.
It is known for its "Turk Language Assembly" ("Diwan Lugat At-Turk"), a dictionary reference book of various Turkmen languages, and an equal turcological encyclopedia.
Some researchers believe (without factual support) that in about 1080 Mahmoud returns to Kashgar, where he continues to work on the "Turk Slovar" until October 1083.
The year and place of his death are unknown, but some Uighur scientists believe that he died in 1101 and 1126, and they claim that Mahmoud Kashgary was buried in the Kyrgyz village of Opal, near Kashgar.
The Turk world of Mahmoud Kashgary is the first scientific map of the settlement of the Turkic tribes.
The famous book of Mahmoud Al-Kashgary, "Divani Lugat al-türk", is an encyclopaedia that collects and consolidates extensive historical, cultural, ethnographic and linguistic material. "Divani" al-Kashgari is a monument to the culture of Turk, which perpetuates ethical values and standards of behaviour, and a specific world view of the people of Turk in the eleventh century.
The book, along with the ancient Zoroastrian-Shamanist world view, captures the basic elements of Islam and its branches such as soufism.

Mahmoud Al-Kashgari was born in the city of Barshan[1] [Comm 1] [Comm 2], the capital of a large Turkish Muslim State, now known as the Karahanid, in a local noble family.
According to Ukrainian-American orientist Omelyan Prizaka[2], Mahmoud Kashgari was a member of the Bograhan clan of the ruling Karahanid dynasty and was the son of Hussein bin Muhammad, the Emir of the city of Barshan, the grandson of the ruler of Kashgar Muhammad Bograhan, and the great-grandson of Harun (al-Khasan) and Ibn Suleiman Bograhan.[1][3]
Life
Mahmoud Al-Kashgari received a good education at that time.
He studied in the Sajia madrass in Kashgar, where teachers known in the region, such as Imam Zahid Hussein, taught.
In 1056, Mahmud's grandfather, Muhammad Bograhan, came to power in Kashgar, who decided 15 months later to transfer power to his son Hussein, the Emir of Barshan, the father of Mahmoud Kashgary.
The view that Mahmoud Kashgari was the son of Hussein bin Muhammad, the Emir of the city of Barshan, was supported by the Ukrainian-American Easter Omelyan Pricak.[1]
But soon, as a result of the palace plot, Hussein and Muhammad Bograhan were poisoned.
As a result, Mahmoud was forced to flee Kashgar in 1057.
He goes west to Maverannakhr, and from there he goes to Baghdad, where the Seljuks are ruled.
In addition, Mahmoud travels for a long time on lands inhabited by the Turkmen peoples and tribes.
Tonjukuk (646-724) was a political and military figure of the Second Kyrgyz Kaganate.
He was raised "under the influence of Chinese culture".
He was educated in the capital of the Tang Chanani Empire.
During the restoration of the independence of the ancient türks, Kutlug's closest adviser and associate, who took the title of Elterish Kagan, initiated an active and conquering foreign policy.
He later became the co-ruler of Bilge Cagan, the son of Kutlug Elterish Cagan.
There is an inscription in the Orkhono-Enisei text in honour of Tonyukuk:
In 679 the Turk tribes, settled in the Tang Empire after the death of the First Turkish Kaganate, were organizing a mutiny to re-establish the Kaganata.
The mutiny lifts up the Ashide genus from which Tonyukuk came.
The rebels have been defeated by the elected seven-regent Divisions of Pei Shin Jiang, and the re-insurgency led by Prince Funan has been repressed by the same Pei Shin Jiang.
However, as early as 682 the most "intransigent" associates of Funan, led by Prince Kutlug, are still re-establishing the kaganat.
The enlightened Tonyukuk joins Kutlug and has since become one of the main Buyrukov (advisers) of the Kyrgyz Kagans.
After the sudden death of Capagan Kagan in 716, during a basmy camping trip, Tonjukuk is supporting a party of yellow-headed turrets, apparently Serov.
As a result, the throne is in the hands of the opposing party of the Kul-tegan and Mogilian brothers.
Many yellowhead supporters will be executed, but Tonyukuk will be left alive, given his merit in the turquoise and his relationship with the Togilian.

The "coronation" of the Kagan was attended by the Tardus with Kül-shruh, followed by the Shadabiks (Western military wing), the Toles headed by apa-tarhan (titul) (eastern wing), Taman Tarkan, Tonyukuk Boyla Baga Tarkan, Buyuruk (may be a name and title), and Kül-Erkin Kül-tekin was immediately appointed as the Eastern Knit.
All of Capagan's advisers were executed, and seven decades old Tonyuk Apa-tarhan was appointed as Kagan's counselor, although Bilge doubted him.
The turks were worried, the Khans were reluctant to listen to the Kagana, and Bilge decided that the war with Tang would unite the prison.
When they are strong, they go forward to gain; when they are weak, they turn away, and hide themselves; and the forces of the House of Than are numerous, but there is no place to use them.
They live in the cities, as soon as they are broken in battle, the captivity is inevitable; above this teaching of Buddha and Lao Tzu, it makes people human and weak, not militant and powerful."
The entire foreign policy of the kaganata was in Kul-tegan's hands.
It appears that the new Caghan has rapidly worsened its relationship with the Tocus-goose (the ancient Uighurs), some of which joined Tang and some were defeated in the Battle of Selenga.

In addition to the Uighur translation of the Sutra, there were Mongolian, Tibetan, Sogdian, Turkmen, Chotanosak, and a rewritten letter from the Tangutian State.
The scientist concluded that after two centuries (early 20th century) there were no memories of their native writing among Uighurs, although almost all the main Buddhist books were translated by Uighurs into their own language and stored in monastic libraries.

After the poisoning of Bilge Khan, Bogu raised his eldest son, Ishan, under the name Yollyg-tegan.
He continued his father &apos; s policy of suppressing the self-restraint of unit Khans and maintaining good-neighbourly relations with Tan.
Sent three embassies to the court of Xuan-Zun to exchange gifts.
In 739 he died suddenly.
His brother Bilge-Kutlug-han was raised to the throne.
Creation
The Yollig of the gag can be called the first Turkmen poet, writer, and historian.
He was the author of a series of commemorative inscriptions in honour of King Kül-tegan and Bilge-Kagan, as well as Kutlug Ilteres-Kagan.
These inscriptions reflect the cultural level of the altaic turks, their poetry, prose, historical knowledge and the ideology of the Eastern Turki Kaganata.[2]

He was born on April 26, 1921, in Penza, in a Tartar family, where his parents moved to Jalal Abad, Kyrgyzstan, where the future scientist graduated from school.
Although his life was linked to linguistics and ethnography, the Moscow Institute of Railway Engineers was the first university to which he applied.
In 1969, E. R. Tenishev was protected by his Ph.D. on the subject "The Construction of the Salari Language",[1] and at that time he continued his study of the ancient non-jurisdictional monuments of literature and Turkmen languages.
An important development for Turkology was the initial work on the four-volume collective monograph "The equal historical grammar of the Turkic languages".

As a result of the defeat of the Yueban State in 490 the Googyus formed their state in eastern Kazakhstan.
It was divided into two parts, the northern ruler being named "The Heavenly Emperor," and the southern one being "The Crown Lord".
Six years later, however, the southern part of Gaojia was defeated and put under the control of the buzz.
The northern part of Gaojui lasted 45 years and was destroyed by buzz in 540.

==History==In N. I. Bichchinin, Googhui are the descendants of Chi-di: they were first called dils; later they were called Googhu dinlins and oichoras.
Chi-di[3] and Dinlin were, in his opinion, Mongol.[4]
S. Shabalov believes that Chi-di, Dili, Gaogyu and Hoyhu (ohor) originally spoke Mongolian.[5]
In his view, the peoples in question had, in the late fourth century, moved into Kyrgyz-Higag after contact with the Kyrgyz-Hiyagas.[6]

Ethnonym
The language of Hazara was said to belong to a Turkish language family, allegedly belonging to its Bulgar group.[4]
Settlement area, political expansion
Khazar Kaganat
Until the seventh century, the hazara were subordinate to each other in successive nomadic empires.
In the 560s, they became part of the Turki Kaganata, and after the collapse of the last in the mid-seventh century, they established their own State, the Khazar Kaganat (650–969), which became one of the most durable nomad associations in the region.[5]
Initially living north of Derbent within the modern plain of Dagestan, the hazars began to settle in controlled regions: Crimea, Don, and especially Lower Volt, where the capital of the State was transferred in the eighth century.
Several Hazar groups were forcibly relocated to Zakawkaziya as a result of the long wars against Iran and the Arab caliphate.
Religious beliefs consisted of all-Türk pagan rituals, characterized by the worship of the god Tengri and the burning of the Cagan.
Thanks to the geographical position and the tolerant policy of the Government, Christianity and Islam have been heavily infested into the Hazarian environment.
In the VIII–IX V.C. part of the Khazar, led by the ruling family, was converted to Judaism.
Hazara's name is self-titled, his etymology is unclear.
In one version, it comes from the Kurk base kaz, which refers to nomadism.[1]
It has also been suggested that it follows:

Origin
According to some researchers (B. N. Zahoeder), the Hazarian ethnic group had a dualist basis, combining the two main tribes, the white and black hazars (Kalis-Hazara and Kara-Hazara).
Proponents of another view (M. I. Artamonov, A. P. Novoseltsev) consider this division to be a social rather than an ethnic one and point to a more complex organization, and in close connection with the Hazar tribal union, Barsil, Savira, Balandjar and others. They were later partially assimilated.
The most close to the hasars were barsils, with which they are often mentioned in the early days of history, and Bersilia's country is the source of the starting point for the Hazar expansion in Europe.
The following hypotheses are made concerning the origin of the Hazar and their forebears:
Hazars are descendants of the Gunn Acacir tribe, known in Europe since the fifth century (A. V. Gadlo, O. Prizak).
Hazars are of Uighur origin, from the Central Asian people of Kosa, mentioned in Chinese sources.
(D. Dunlop) (see main article of Uighur theory of origin of Hazar).
Khazar are descendants of ephthalites who migrated to the Caucasus from Horasan (Eastern Iran) (D. Ludwig).
Hazars come from a tribal union formed by cucumbers, savirs and in the final stages of the Altai turquoise (P. Golden, M. I. Artamonov, A. P. Novoseltsev, D. Nemet).
The latter point of view (variably) dominates Russian and Ukrainian science.[3]
The Hazarian Cagant (650–969) is a medieval nation created by the Hazara nomadic people.
It's from the Western Turk Cagana.
Controlled Precaucasia, Lower and Middle Volgae, modern North-West Kazakhstan[no source listed 317 days], Prizorje, eastern Crimea, and the steppe and foresting of Eastern Europe up to Dniepra.
The center of state was originally located in the seaside part of modern Dagestan, later moved to the lower Volga, and part of the ruling elite accepted Judaism.
For a long time, Hazaria competed with the Arab caliphate in the struggle for domination in the Zakawkaz region.
A number of East Slavian tribal unions, some of the Caucasus and the Zacaucasian peoples, were politically dependent on Hazar.
Since 630, numerous internecine clashes have led to the collapse of the Western Turk Caganate.
This led to the emergence of two new political entities on the periphery of Eastern Europe: the Great Bulgaria, founded by Khan Kubrat in 632 and the Hazaria in the Caspian Sea region.

It appears that, after this event, the ruler of Hazaria assumed the highest title of Kagan in the nomadic hierarchy.
By the seventh century, the hazars controlled most of the steppe Crimea, Priaziah, and the North Caucasus.
It is not clear how far their control over the steppes east of Volga (the story of the region is least covered in written sources).
However, there is no doubt that the historical consequence of Hazar hegemony has been a halt in the continuous flow of nomads from Asia to Europe, which has had a positive impact on the East Slavian tribes and the peoples of Central Europe.[10]

The History of a Jewish Kingdom in Europe (in Hebrew) is a Tel Aviv, 1944.
During this period, Hazaria &apos; s attention was drawn to the Zacaucasus, whose farming States promised nomads rich sources of production.
The incursions were carried out in two ways, through Derbent, in the Caucasus of Albania, Armenia and beyond, to Iran or, less frequently, through the Darial Gorge, located in the Alan and leading to Georgia.
The impact of Hazar in the region was so significant that in a number of eastern languages the Caspian Sea was known as the Hazarski.[11]
However, the expansion of Hazar came upon a counter-event here when the Arab caliphate appeared at the site of Sasanid Iran.
His troops occupied Georgia and the Caucasus Albania, after which, in 653, they married Derbent and attacked Hazara's possession of Belenger, resulting in the defeat of Arab forces and the death of his leader Salman bin Rabi.[12]
Wars with Arabs.
The eighth century
Hazaria was in a union with Byzantium, which was defending itself from the Caliphate in Asia Minor, when the Arabs laid siege to Konstantinopol in 717–718, the hazars pulled off a part of their forces and invaded the Caucasus Albania[15] and Azerbaijan.[16] At the end of 730, the most large-scale Hazar raid took place.
He was led by the son of the Kaghan, Barjil, who was attacked by the Iranian city of Ardebil. A 25-thousand Arab army was defeated and one of the high-ranking military leaders, Jarrah, was killed.
A number of Khazar troops reached Diyarbakir and the outskirts of Mosul, but by the beginning of the following year, a fresh Arab army under the command of Said al-Harashi, who was then replaced by Maslam (namely, a decade earlier, who had besieged the capital of Byzantium), knocked out the hazar from all the positions seized, and the fighting moved to the territory of the kaganate.
The war continued in 732/733, and the Khazar kagan was wounded in a battle near Derbent, and control of the strategic fortress finally passed to the Arabs.
In 737 the Arab general Marwan bin Muhammad (the future calif) led by the 150-thousand army suddenly invaded Hazariya simultaneously through Derbent and Darial.
Kagan fled to the depths of his estates, and in pursuit of him the Arabs went north before ever, up to the Slavian River, apparently Dona or Volga.
In exchange for preserving the throne, he promised to accept Islam, but this procedure seemed to have been nominal.[19]
Hazariah maintained her independence, and the Arabs left the North Caucasus, and soon there was another turmoil in Caliphate.
The Abbasid dynasty came to power there, which refused further expansion to the north.
The acceptance of Judaism and the rise of the Bulanid dynasty.
Sir VIII — Start of the 9th Century
An important factor in the history of the Khazar Kaganat was that Jewish communities lived in the territory under its control, including in the homeland of Hazar — in Dagestan.[27]
In about 740, one of Khazar's military commanders, Bulan, moved to Judaism.
It is very likely that the new order was accompanied by internecine clashes, a part of which was known as the Kawars, rose against the ruling dynasty and went to the Hungarians after the repression of the rebellion.
The Kaganate in the 9th Century
Since then, Hazaria &apos; s policy has shifted from conquering international transit trade, but the foreign policy situation for the kaganath has been unfavourable. In the ninth century, a new wave of great displacement of peoples began, and new Asian nomads have begun to cross the Volga.
The first people to be displaced to the west coast of Volga were Hungarians, and in the 830s they occupied the North Black Sea.
Early history.
The sixth century
The fall of the kaganath.
X-century
In the year 913/914, a Russian fleet of russians was allowed to enter the Caspian Sea for a share of hazara production, and when the fallen army returned, it was attacked and killed.In 939 a Russian leader, Helg[43], at the instigation of Byzantium, attacked the Hazar outpost of Samkerz[44] in the Taman peninsula.
Hazara was initially one of many nomadic tribes that moved from Asia during the Great Relocation of Peoples.
They spoke one of the early Turkmen languages,[2] and it appears from indirect data that they belonged to the peoples of the Ogur group, the first of which appeared in Europe in 463.[3]
The earliest reliable news of the hazars is the reference in the list of peoples listed by Pseudo-Zahariy in 555.[4]
As their European homeland, the source area of Bersilia is located in the plains of modern Dagestan.[5]
The ancient Russian State played a decisive role in the death of Hazaria, and in 964, the Prince of Saint-Slav freed the last Hazar-dependent Slavic tribe of the Vyatichi, and in the next 965 he defeated the Hazarian army with a Kagan in charge and captured Sarkel, who had since become the Russian city of White Veja.
It appears that Samkerz (Tmutarakan) was also captured at that time, followed by the destruction of Etil and Semender in 965 or, according to other data, in 968/969, by the Russians in an alliance with the goose.[51]
This is the end of an independent Hazar State.[52]
The rise of Hazar is related to the history of the Turki Kaganata, whose rulers were probably related to the Khazar rulers.
In 551 the Altais, led by the Kagans of Ashin, formed a huge empire, which soon split into the east and west.
In the second half of the sixth century, the orbit of the Western-Turk kaganate reached the foothills of the Caspian Sea, and all the local associations recognized its primacy.
The expansion to the Zacaucasus and the Black Sea.
The seventh century
As the great military force of Hazara is first mentioned in connection with the Iranian-wizant war of 602–628 in which the Khazar king of Jebuqagan became the main agent of the Turkish-Vizantian alliance against Iran.[8] In 627, the Hazarian army looted the Caucasus of Albania and, joining the Byzantine, stormed Tbilisi.[8]

The Hazarian pagan is the extinct language of Hazar.
No text found.
Three works of Hazara origin, written in Hebrew, used by the ruling Jewish elite, are known (see Hebrew-Hazara correspondence, Kiev letter).
The hazars themselves used a variety of runic scripts, which are known from individual epigraphic inscriptions, but have not yet been decoded.
Some 60 Khazar personal names and several geographical names are known from foreign written sources (especially Arabic and Byzantine).
Among them are individual nouns.
For example, bullan is "sleep", kel is "a tower", čiček is "colour", adjectives: alp is "brilliant", colour symbols: sār is "white", sārøg is "yellow", and others.
Most names and titles are Turkic.
The conclusion that Hazarsky belongs to the Bulgar group, which in turn is the most archaic among the Western Turkic languages, is based on an analysis of the word "Sarkel", which is considered to be the reference (i.e. reliably unsustained) and has characteristic characteristics of the branch (rotacism).
And also on the testimony of the Arab authors of Al-Istakhri and Ibn Haukal, who noted the similarities between the languages of bulgar and Hazar on the one hand, and the unlikeness of the Hazar language in the speeches of the other türks on the other.
In modern languages, the nearest language to the Hazarian language is the Duchess language.
Signs of influence of Hazarsky are available in a number of Turkmen languages (Karayim, Kumak and northern Azerbaijani dialects).

According to the most common view, the bulgars were part of an Ogur array of tribes originally residing in Central Asia.
From this point of view, the bulgars were one of the earliest groups in Turkmenistan to move to Europe during the Great Displacement of Peoples.[12]

In the 1990s, the theory of Eastern Iranian origin of bulgar was popular among some Bulgarian historians.
According to this view, the ancient bulgars were Iranian-speaking and lived in an area between the western part of Hindu Kush, Parapamiz and the Oxom River (Amu or Higon), separating it from the northern part of Sogdiana.
In ancient times, it was called Bactria, or Balhara, with its capital in Balkh.
Hence, Bulgarian historians use the ethno-native Bulgarians to draw on the fact that the bulgar of Armenian sources called the Bullhi, as well as the references in Indian sources of the Balkhiki people and the Bulgar homeland in the Iméon Mountains (where Bektria was) in early Middle Ages sources.[14]
Proponents of the theory believe that the ancient bulgar initially spoke East Iranian, but then changed it into Turkmen.
Outside Bulgaria, this theory has not been widely disseminated.[18]
Bulgars, Bolgares (Lat. Bullgars, Greeks).
==History==The Turkish tribes[1] are from the fourth century of the North Primary to the Caspian Sea and the North Caucasus and migrate in the second half of the seventh century, partly in Podinavia, and later in the Middle Volga and a number of other regions.
Early bulgar story.
The IV - VI Century
Evidence of the Fourth Century
Location of the ~650 bulgar.
The first reference to bulgars in a synchronic source is contained in an anonymous Latin chronograph of 354 years, where the names of Vulgars (Vulgares) are on the list of the Tribes and Peoples of Prichernomor and Pricepia (Sim &apos; s extremities).[25]
The earliest retrospective reference to the bulgar is made by Armenian historian Movses Horenazi of the fifth century. According to him, under Armenian King Arshak I, son of Wagarshak, the bulgar settled in Armenian lands:
Modern peoples such as the Balkarans, the Bashkirs, the Bulgarians, the Gagauz, the Karachaevs, the Tatars, the Nogai and the dudes participated in ethnogenis.
They gave their name to the State of Bulgaria.
Modern history also uses the terms protobolgars, great Bulgarians, ancient Bulgarians.[4]
Arshak I's reign dates back to 1/2 II in C.E. [27], which casts doubt on historians about the reliability of the report.
Moves Horenazi refers to Mar Abas Katina, who lived at the end of the third to fourth centuries.
Bulgars and goons
In early medieval history, there is a confusion between the Bulgar tribes and the Gunnes, which left an indelible mark on the moderns by their destructive mid-five-century trips.
In its "Church History" (the middle of the sixth century), Zaharius Rytor refers to all tribes (including burgar) living north of the Caucasus in the Caspian Sea as Gunn, but Jordan divides the bulgar and the Gunn, describing in the middle of the sixth century their settlement:
Bulgars on the Danube.
The V - VI Century
Terminology
Shortly before that, the bulgar appeared on the Danube.
A note in the fields of the Bulgarian translation of the Greek poem chronicle of Constantin Manassia (XIIth century) refers to relocation in 475.[31]
At this time, the bulgars have a nomadic lifestyle, which periodically disturbs the boundaries of the Byzantine Empire, the first raid on Thrace was in 491 or, according to Marcellyn Comit's chronicle, in 499.
The variation of the root sound "o" or "u" depends on the characteristics of the different languages. In the original root sound of the vowel after "b" sounded as the middle between the vowel "u" and "o", the Danube Bulgarians used a solid "u" in the Tartar and Bashkir languages of the background corresponding to the graph "o", which sounded as the middle between the vowel "u" and "o".
Today's Bulgarians call themselves the Bulgary, "I" in the Bulgarian alphabet pronounced as a neutral seam.
The name of the bulgar was used by Greeks who described this period of history in written sources.
The name Bulgarians, using a hard "o", was used by Russian recorders who described the Russian prince's military trips to Volzhsky Bulgaria.
An Arab traveler, an Islamic missionary, Abu Hamid Al-Garnathi, who visited Volzhsk Bulgaria in 1135 and 1150, refers to his reading of the "Bulgar History", which states that the word bulgar is an Arabized form of the local word of the Balar, a smart man.[5]
Another etymology of the ethnonym of bulgar was cited more than a hundred years ago by Hungarian linguistic scientist Bernat Munkachi: bulgar, "five eels".
According to D. M. Dunlop, an ethno-native goes back to the shapes of beshgur, bashgur, i.e. five tribes, five eels.
Since Sh in modern language corresponds to L in Bulgar, Danlop therefore believes that the ethnonyms bash (bashgur) and bulgar (bulgar) are equivalent.[8]
Another version was put forward by Russian historian A. P. Novoseltsev: "The term bulgars in the second part certainly reflects their initial connection to the eels, and in the first part apparently goes back to the Turk's ‘bulga' ("mix") and then the whole word means `mixed eels'."[9]
Chagatai pagan (Jagatai language), Chagatai Turki, Old-Ouzbec,[3][4] (
The language was used as a literary language until the standard Uzbek was removed during the USSR.
For example, in 1922, the Jadidi magazine Hakikat was published in Chadian in Tashkent.[8]
The Chagatai language is a descendant of the Kahanid language,[9] [10] but also includes elements of the Samarkand dialect and the Andijan (predences of modern Uzbek), and the legacy of the Ancient language is the use of Uighur graphics, which is written by early Chadian essays.[11]
Owing to the constant mixing of the Turkmen population and the movement of geographical centres, the language has introduced multiple dialectic forms of different Turkish-speaking communities.
Overall, however, it was based on a dwarf grammatical basis.
In addition to the Karluk language framework, the Chagatai has features of the Oguz influence (on the territory of Khorezma), as well as certain features of the Kipchak languages in places of close contact with their hosts.[12][13]
Some forms of Azeri language have entered Chadian.[14]

Kubrat's Board
Great Bulgaria
Monogram from the Trans-Champin treasure
The Kubrat (Kurt or Huvrat) was born Oct. 605.
In 632 the Cubrat ascended to the throne.
From Emperor Byzantium Iraklia Kubrat received a San patriotia.
The great Bulgaria at the Khan of Kubrat was independent of both Awar and Hazar.
But if the danger from the west was entirely in view of the weakening of the Awar Caganate, then the threat was constantly on the east side, while Kubrat was alive, he had enough strength to keep the Bulgar tribes united and to resist the danger.
He died at about 665 Cubrat.
On the basis of the results of the study, Werner issued a monograph in which he concluded scientifically that the Cave was a complex of burial objects related to the burial of Khan Kubrat.
The Bulgarian Association of Ukraine set up a memorial at the site in 2001.
Dissolution of the State
After Kubrat's death, the territory of the Great Bulgaria was traditionally divided into five of his sons, Batbayan, Kotrag, Asprauch, Kubur, Alzek, each of the sons of Kubrat led his own horde, and none of them had the strength to compete with the hazars.
The Great Bulgaria ceased to exist during a clash with the Hazaras in the 660s.

The group of the Bulgar tribes (632 – 671) formed in the steppes of Eastern Europe.
The main territory was located in the Black Sea and Azov steppes.
The territory of the Bulgarian Union had no clear boundaries, extending from the Lower Don to the suburbs of Kubani and from Tamani to the Kuma and Eastern Manich.[1]
The foundation of the association was the Bulgar Kutrigur tribe, which was able to free itself from the power of the Awars, whose power was undermined by a failed attempt to seize Konstantinopol (626).
The eldest son of Batbayan (Bezmer) remained in place with his horde, and these groups became Hazar Dancers and were later known as "black Bulgarians." They are mentioned in the contract of Prince Igor with Byzantium.
Igor is committed to protecting the Byzantine properties in Crimea from black Bulgarian attacks.
Volga Bulgaria
Kubrath's second son, Cotrag, crossed Don and settled across from Batbayan (Bezmera).
This group of Bulgar tribes may have moved north and later settled in the middle Volga and Kama, where the Volga Bulgaria originated, and the Volgian Bulgars are the ancestors of the middle Volga population: Tatars and dudes.
Danube Bulgaria
Kubrath's third son, Asparuch, with his horde, went to the Danube and ok. 680, staying in the lower Danube, created the Bulgarian Kingdom.
The local Slavic tribes fell under the reign of the Bulgar, and over time the bulgars merged with the Slavs, and a Bulgarian nation emerged from the blending of the Asparukh bulgar and its various Slavic and the remnants of the Fraki tribes.
The term "Old Great Bulgaria" is taken from Byzantine sources, where it refers to the area of residence of the main bulgar groups prior to their resettlement in the second half of the seventh century.

Establishment of the State
Han Kubrat (Kurbat)[1] (632-665) succeeded in merging his tribe with other Bulgar tribes of Kutrigur, Utigur, Onogur and other tribes (formerly dependent on Awars).[2]
The association of the Bulgar tribes may have been initiated by the organ, Uncle Kubrat, Nikifor (IX V.), describing the events of 635, said: "In the same time, Kuvrat, a relative of the organs, the king of the Gundoor, against the Awar Cagana and all the people who were around him insulted him, drove him out of his homeland.
He sent messengers to Irakli, and made peace with him for the rest of their lives.
After being freed from the power of the West Turk Cagana, Kubrat expanded and consolidated his power, which the Greeks called the Great Bulgaria.
Voljsk Bulgaria (Bolgar Haniya[6], Volzhsko-Kamsk Bulgaria[7], Silver Bulgaria; tat.
Idel Bolgar, dude. Atäl·i·i· P·lhar)[8] is a historic state in the Middle Volgae and the Kama basin, which existed from the Xth to the 13th century.
In 965, after the fall of the Khazar Kaganat, his former Vassal Bulgaria became completely independent, but suffered from the eastern march of the Kiev Prince of Saint-Slav Igorević in those years (964–969).
During the 10th century, the Kiev Russians organized four military trips to Volzhsk Bulgaria in 977, 985, 994 and 997.
Bulgar State and neighbouring States, 1025
In 1088, the Kami bulgars briefly captured Moore, and in 1107, the Volzhi bulgars laid siege to Susdal.
The Mongolian Infestation
In 1223, after the Battle of Kalka, the Mongolian troops left east through the lands of the Volzhi bulgar and were beaten headlong by the Bulgar forces.[14] This defeat, like the defeat of Perwan in 1221, was an exception to the achievements of the Mongolian army during the conquest period until the defeat of Ayn Jalut in 1260.
In 1229, the bulgars and sexmen were smashed by the Mongols at the Yaik River, Ural, and in 1232 the Mongols reached the site of the Jukot River Kamu.
Finally, in 1236, the Mongolian army, led by Subedei, destroyed the entire Volzhsko-Kamian Bulgaria.[~ 2]
Before the Mongolian infestation
In the second half of the 7th century, one of the Ords, mostly from the Kutrigur tribes, moved from the Great Bulgar to the north under Kotrag, and settled in the Mid-Wolga and Kama areas, dispersing among the predominantly Finnish-Hormonal tribes.

The Bulgars gradually replaced or conquered the Balto Slavic tribes (the population of the "Nemen culture"), subjugating the Barajar, the Barsil, the Sair, the Esegels, the Birco- and the other Finno-Dangerous tribes.
As a result, the Bulgar tribe union was formed in the 8th century in the Middle Volgia.
Later, the population of the Volzhská Bulgaria included certain groups of the Oguzo-Teamens and Kipchak tribes, as well as neighbouring peoples (Burtas, Majara, Muroma, etc.).
In 922, the Baltavar (King) Almush, in search of military support against the Hazar, whose rulers practised Judaism, invited an embassy from Baghdad, officially declared Hanafit Islam as a State religion, and accepted the title of Emir and the name Jafar Bin Abdallah.[9]
However, "people" (subjugated tribe, clan) Savan[10], headed by "King Virag," probably expressed dissatisfaction with this ("rejected"), resulting in aristocracy of Bulgarians divided into two parties (the second head of "King Askal").
After threats from Almush (to strike with the sword), the first party also obeyed, and apparently the "King" Virag, with the title of Savan, was the second person (the second step below the hakan) in Volzhi Bulgaria after the Almush Baltawar (the first step below the hakan).
In addition, it is known that the "King of Almush" and his tribe had "four subordinate kings" with their subordinate tribes, which corresponds to the structure of the State and one of the theory of the Bulgar entity, "five parts".[11]
These events and facts were described in notes from a participant in the Baghdad Embassy at Volga Ahmed Ibn Fadlan.[12]
After Almush, his son Mikael Bin Jagfar and then his grandson Abdullah Bin Mikael.[13]

Ismael Gasprinski in 1872 while studying at Sorbonne
Born in the village of Awjika (other information in the neighbouring village of Ulu Sala), Yalta county of Tauri District[3] (now Bahchisarai district of Crimea) in the family of an officer of the Russian service, Mustafa Ali-Golou Gasprinski and his wife Fatma-Sultan Temir-Gazi-Kyzi (named Kantakuzov).
Mustafa Ali-gol was born on the southern bank of Crimea, ahul Gaspra, and therefore took the name of Gasprinski. On 19 April 1854, the family was approved in noble dignity.
Ishmael Gasprinski received a home education, at primary school (mectebe), at the Simferopol masculine gymnasium, in the Voronezh Cadet Corps, and then at the 2nd Moscow military gymnasium.[4] Without completing his studies he returned to Crimea, where he became a teacher of primary school.
In 1871 he left for France, where he studied at Sorbonne, University of Paris.
He lived in Turkey from 1874 to 1875.
When he returned to Crimea, he was elected to the Bachchisarai City Duma.
From February 13, 1879 to March 5, 1884, Bachchisaraya was the head of the city.
Since 1879, Ismail Gasprinski has made repeated attempts to set up his own newspaper publisher, Faidaly Eglandge (1879-1880), the Law (1881).
Since April 10, 1883, Gasprinsky has been allowed to publish and edit the first Russian newspaper, "Translationer of Terjimana".
It has long been the only Turkish-language periodical in Russia, and since the beginning of the 20th century, the oldest Muslim newspaper in the world.
The newspaper lasted almost 35 years and was closed on 23 February 1918.
Ishmael Gasprinsky's ideas were disseminated in Crimea, Idel Urala, Hivin Khanism, and Bukhar Khanism through the "Translationist".
In addition, the newspaper was distributed in Percy, China, Turkey, Egypt, Bulgaria, France, Switzerland, and the United States.

Founder of Jadidism Ismail Gasprinski (1872) in a European costume, fesca and moustache
Jadidism (from the Arab, "new", Arab, "new", Crimean-tat. Usul-i Cedid, tat.
Yaditselek () is an ideology of Islamic modernism in the late 19th - early 20th - century Russian empire, opposed to cadimism, a conservative direction in Russian Islam.
Jadidism is sometimes widely understood as synonymous with Muslim modernism as a whole, and even people such as Jamaluddin al-Afghani are considered to be such.[1] The immediate founder of Jadism is a Crimean Tatar educator and politician, Ismail Gasprinski[2][3].
The 1908 Young Turkish Revolution gave some impetus to the development of Jadidism and contributed to their eventual politicization.
In 1908, the Jadids began publishing in Orenburg a magazine called Shuro, the Council, where Rizaitdin Fahretdinov promoted the idea of the succession of Volzhsk Bulgaria, the Golden Orda and the Casan Khany.
In 1917, in the wake of the disintegration of the Russian empire in Tashkent, Shura-i-Islam (Islamic Council) was formed,[1] and in Kokand, Turkestan autonomy was proclaimed.[2] The local version of the Jadidists was the Mladoubhars who practised similar ideas on the territory of the Bukhar Emirat[5] as well as the Mladhivians.
With regard to the Soviet authorities, the Jadid took a contradictory position.
Some took part in the alliance with Bolsheviks in the formation of the Central Asian socialist nations (Faizulla Khojaev, Abdurauf Fitrat, Sadriddin Aini, Mirzo Muhiddin Mansurov, Majid Kadyri), while others joined the anti-Council basmatic movement (Usman Hoja).[2]
Political views
The Jadids were heavily influenced by European political thought, especially constitutional ideas, as well as by the Young Turkish Movement in the Ottoman Empire, who advocated for parliamentarians,[12] believing that the principle of representative power is enshrined in the Koran under the term Shura (Council).
Women were declared electoral rights.[13] At the beginning of the Jadidia, the principle of constitutional monarchy was upheld, but since 1917, they began to bow to republican ideas (per.
The classic Jadids advocated cultural and territorial autonomy (muchtaria) of Turkestan within Russia, but in the era of World War I, the radical wing began to speak from pro-Turkeyn positions.
Jadidism by region
In the Caucasus, a party based on Jadidism was established under the ownership of Elhan Shah, which laid the foundations of modern Azerbaijani statehood.
The extremist group of the Kawkaz Jadidists was formed in October 1905 by Difai, and Jadidism was also influenced in Dagestan (Nuhai Batyrmurzaev).[18]
During the period of the Russian empire, the spiritual center of Kazakhstan was Orenburg (later the centre of Kyrgyz autonomy), where the Jadid madrasa of Husainia was opened in 1891.
Under madrasa, a Society for the Study of Kazakh Language was organized.[19]
The word "jadid" with the phrase "Usul Jadid" (new method) appeared in 1898 in connection with the updating of the curricula in the Tatar madrass.
The introduction of the new method was spontaneous at the initiative of young teachers ("Mugallims").
However, conservative circles of Muslim clergy from the Orenburg Authority have seen this as a loss of credibility and have accused supporters of the "new method" of replacing the Arabic language with the Tatar language, of "Europeanization" and of potential secular and revolutionary sentiments.[4]

In the Russian Empire, the population was divided not by national but by religious and religious principle.
So one of the segments of Russian society was Muslims united in spiritual government.
The general modernization of Russia in the nineteenth century (industrialization, education) gave Russian Muslims a choice: either to modernize with the whole country or to go into isolation.
Consequently, there was an implicit division between the Jadids and the Cadimists.
An inevitable example for Russian Muslims in the nineteenth century was the Ottoman Empire, which led to the panturkist slope of jadidism.[5][6]
The immediate founder of Jadidism was the Crimean Tatar educator and politician Ismail Gasprinski[7], who, in 1883, began publishing the newspaper Transducer-Terjeman in Crimean Tatar and Russian.
In the same year, he opened the first Jadid school in Bahchisara.
Women &apos; s education has also received great attention from Gaspring.
On August 15, 1905, the Jadidists of Gasprinsky were able to create Ittifak al-Muslimin (---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------and------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The party was represented in the Russian State Duma.
The party was actively represented by the Mufti Samarkanda Mahmoudhodja Behbudi[10], for whom Tamerlan was an enlightened ruler.
Another member of the Ittifak Party, the Peterburg Imam, Musa Bigueev, translated the Koran into the Tartar language in 1912 for which he received the nickname "Musulman Luther." Another member of the Abdurashid Ibrahimov Party suggested overcoming the division between Shiites and the Sunnis and suggesting a focus on the Japanese Empire.

Krobat (bolg. Krobat)[1] Kurbat, Kurt (bolg. Kurt) is the ruler of the Bulgar Unogundour tribe[1][2.
Basic information
The exact years of Kubrat's life and death have not been recorded by sources.
A memorial to the Khan of Kubrat at the alleged burial site of the Little Cross, Poltava region.
Between 634 and 640 Cubrat was released from power.
He united a number of tribes under his command into an alliance known by Byzantine sources from the eighth to the sixth centuries as the Great Bulgaria (the Great Bulgaria).
Presumably from the Dulo dynasty.
"After the death of K[ubrat] [near the end of the reign of the Byzant [Visant] imp[Cerator] Constant II (641–668), probably Oct. 660–665], " states A. V. Komar, "the association that he led has been dissolved; part led by K[ubrat's son Batbayan was subservient to the hasars, others migrated, including the Lord of the 2nd son K[ubrat]—Asparuch, who founded the First Bulgarian Kingdom on the Danube."[1]
Cubrat's sons and their future fate
According to the record writer Feofan the Confessor and other sources, Kubrat had five sons.
The eldest son of Batbayan fulfilled his father's covenant and stayed in Great Bulgaria, but after the departure of his brothers with separate tribes, he was unable to resist and was subdued by them, committing to pay them tribute, according to Feofan Confessor:
Great Bulgaria and the relocation of Bulgarian
Next to him on the other side of Don's, the eldest son, Cotrag, with the Cottorag tribe (cotrigours), settled.
It appears that these are the two parts of Bulgarian that later become known in the Middle Volgia, where the State of the Volzha Bulgaria emerged.
The third son of Asprauch is head of the Utigur tribe, and he inherits the western part of the Great Bulgaria on the northwest part of the Black Sea coast.
On the left side of the Danube River, the invasion of South Dobruju and Meziya is beginning. By joining with the local Slavic tribes, a successful war with Byzantium is taking place and, after a decisive victory over Emperor Constantin IV, the State of Bulgaria is being established.
The fourth son of Kubrath is the ruler of the northwest part of the Great Bulgaria (Dbruja), according to Feofan Confessor:
Most Kubrat researchers are regarded as the founder and first ruler of a tribal confederation known by Byzantine sources from the eighth to the sixth centuries as the Great Bulgaria (Great Bulgaria).[3]
The fifth, the youngest son of Kubrath, according to Feofan the Confessor:
However, according to Archaeologist I. O. Gavrituchin: "Khan V [Great] B[algary] - Blood (Kovrat), after whose death (between 641 and 668) the association was dissolved and its constituent peoples were subject to hazards or fled.
The identification with the Khan's blood of the Unogundours of Kubrath, an ally of the Byzant[an] imp[herator] of Irakli I, as well as the connection with the B[great] B[olgaria] complexes of the Triangular treasure circle, is disputed."[1]

In the first half of the fifth century, gourmets under the control of the Gunn tribe won almost all of Europe and created a huge multi-ethnic power.
After its collapse, the gourd tribes in Europe have been called "hoonnas" for centuries.
In the sixth century, awars (beavers) appeared in Europe and created the Awar Caganate.
In the seventh century, the bulgars were widely spread, and in turn they were replaced by the Western and northern Hazara who created the Hazar Kaganat.
After all, most of the travelers who had previously travelled were gradually assimilated with the local population and the donkeys in modern eastern Europe (Podunavier, Podonje, Pribernomore, Povolgier).

The cucumbers are supposed to have been removed from the common array of Praturk tribes very early.
The selection of cucumbers came from a larger association at that time - the cucumbers, presumably in the middle of the first millennium B.C.[1]
Also associated with the selection of cucumbers is the beginning of the breakdown of the Praturk language into the proper group of Turkmen languages and the Ogur ("Bulgar") group of languages.[2]
The cucumbers were the first of the greats to make several migratory waves westward.

History
==History==In 1942 it was created on the basis of the Corner of the Uzbek State Photokinotrest ("Uzbekkino") and was first called the Frunzen Film Studio (since 1956, the Frunzen Art and Chronical Documentary Film Studio).
It was named in 1961.
Contrary to the plans of the post-war five-year-old film studio in Kyrgyzstan, there was no work in the early post-war years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, many works of Chingiz Aitmatov were filmed on the Kyrgyz Film.
==Career==From Iitmatov's screen coverage, Larissa Shepitko ("Znoy"), Andrei Conchalovski ("First Teacher") began the directorial career.
The studio was later run by local directors: Bolotbek Shamsheev (Shot at Karash Pass, White Boat, Rise to Fujima) and Toloush Okeev (Red Apple, White Barn Spray).
In 1972, he took off "Aly Maquis Issyk-Kul", one of the samples of the so-called hystern.
Algimantas Vidugiris made such artistic films as Men Without Women, Catastrophe Not Allow, and other documentary films.
These three filmmakers (Okeeva, Shamshiva, Vidugiris) are associated with the phenomenon of the Kyrgyz Wonder, a period in which the film studio "Kyrgisfilm" flourishes.
The film studio is now named after filmmaker Tolomus Okeev.
Kutrigur (also kotrigur, curturgur) is a nomadic people who, along with Utigur (or turquoise), formed the basis of protobolgar.
Procopius of Kesarius talks about the Goonna king and his sons, whose names were Utigur and Kutrigur.
After the king's death, a single nation was divided into two tribes, each named by its ruler.
According to Procopius, these tribes initially occupied the lands "on the other side of the marsh" (the sea of Azov) and its mouths (the Strait of Kerchen), which crossed, and attacked the ready-to-tetraxites.
The story of Procopius shows that the cutrigurs settled on the left bank of Istra.
The Danube), while raiding the Eastern Roman Empire, the Utigurs chose to return.[1]
The first references relate to 469–488 years and are contained in the steps of the Dnipro-Donskiy commons.[2]
Probably in the first half of the fifth century, they attacked the east, ready on the west coast of Don, and took possession of the surrounding lands.
On many occasions, they fought with Byzantine and her allies, raiding and camping.
In 558 Khan Zabergan and the Bulgar Slavian troops made a tour of Constantinople.
For a time, the Kutrigur became part of the Avar Caganate for about 562 years.[3]
Subsequently, the future ruler of Kubrat, who created the early Middle Ages State of Great Bulgaria, was born in this tribe.
In 631, part of the Kutrigur under the command of Khan Alzek, Kubrath's son, tried to overthrow the hegemony of the awar, but failed to compete, and turned the Rhine into a franc.
King Dagobert I settled the Kutrigurs in Bavaria, but then ordered them to be massacred in the night.
The survivors found their last refuge in Italy, in the villages of Sepina, Boviana and Inzernia, where they scattered and began to live.
Part of the Kutrigur settled in Macedonia under the leadership of Kubrat Kubur's son, and part headed north-east of Don to the Volgis steppes under the leadership of Kotrag, also the son of Kubrath, where they were called silver Bulgarians and created a strong medieval State of Volzha Bulgaria.

Utigur (Utrigur, Uturgur, Onogur) is a tribal group of bulgar, along with the Kutrigur (Kurturgur) and others, which traveled between Don and Cuba in the fifth century.
In the sixth century, there was a state of war with the Kutrigur (cours) led by their king Sandilh[en].
They subsequently joined the Kyrgyz kaganate for about 568 years.[1] In 633 the Kutrigurs merged with the Uturgur and formed a common State of the Great Bulgaria.[2]
In 670 the bulgars, after Kubrat's death, were defeated by Hazar and Utigur, led by Asprauch in 679 by the lower Danube, and by the lands seized from Byzantium (Mesia and Thrace) were founded by the First Bulgarian Kingdom.[3]
The main archaeological difference between the utriegur and the cutrigur, the head orientation of the dead in the graves to the north as opposed to that of the dead in the graves with the head to the west, and the extensive presence of artificial deformation of the skull as opposed to the Kutrigur, whose custom is unique.

Barsbeck kagan on a commemorative coin
On the basis of the monuments of the Archonian writing, scientists have expressed the view that Bars-Kagan could have become a model of the epic Kyrgyz warrior Manas. S. G. Klashtorny believed that the Altyn-Köl I and Altyn-Köl II monuments were dedicated to twin brothers, the sons of the deceased Bars-Kagan.
In Kyrgyzstan, Barsbek Kagan is declared a national hero.
The National Bank of Kyrgyzstan produced a commemorative coin for Barsbek Kagan.
In 2011, the Barsbecu-Kagana monument was installed in Osh.
In a number of localities in Kyrgyzstan, the name Barsbek-Kagan is called streets.

Bars-kaghan (m. 710/711) was the ruler of the Yenisean Kyrgyz in Hakasko-Minusinsk.
He had the title of Beck, but accepted the title of a claim to the full sovereignty of his State, the kagan.

Second Eastern Turki Kaganate
The father-in-law of the Kaganat dynasty of the rulers.
He married the daughter of Ilteres Cagan, the younger sister of Kul-tegan and Mogilan.
Took the name Eunanchu Alp Bilge.
He was active in foreign policy, joining a coalition with tabgachs and türgesch against the Second Turkish Kaganate.
This led him to be defined as his worst enemy by his turquoise, and as a stunt in the winter of 710/711.
The military expedition led by Tonyukuk, Kul-tekin and Mogilian, in the harsh conditions of winter, overcame the Western Sayans and secretly entered the valley of Ana (Russian-She).
Twice to defeat the Kyrgyz, the curls killed Bars Cagan in the Sung Valley.
Bars Kagan's children subsequently arrived with Kyrgyz embassies in China.

In Mongol time, he merged with the Kaan ("great Khan").
For the first time, Chinese sources have witnessed the Central Asian Sianbi tribe (the third century).
In 402, he was accepted by the buzzmen instead of the Gunn title of Shanyu.
From the buzz, it was borrowed by the awars and the turquoise (since 551), which created in the middle of the sixth century the largest nomadic empire at that time, the Turki kaganat.
After its dissolution, the title was won by many Turkish-speaking peoples (Hazaras, Uighurs, Carluks, Kyrgyzes, Kimakis, etc.).[2]
In Europe, there have been three kaganats since the Great Displacement of Peoples: Awar, Türk and Hazarski, and the "Cagan of Mountains" in some of the Arab chronicles called the ruler of the country Sarir in Horn Dagestan (the sixth century).
==History==In the ninth century, Kagan's title was used in various sources and in relation to the rulers of Rusi, and later, Ilarion called the Kagans the Kagans of Vladimir and Jaroslav the Wise.
The graffiti of the second half of the 11th century from Sofia Kiev is also known, asking God to help "the kagan of ours," perhaps the Prince of Saint-Slav Jaroslavić.
The term, however, was more of an ad hoc honorary definition than an official title.[4]
In the form of a caan, it appears in sources from the 13th century onwards.
This is the name of the supreme ruler of the Grand Mongol Ulus, and this title is enshrined in law in Yas Chinghis Khan:

==History==The Yat Ha group was formed in 1992 in Moscow by Albert Kuvezin and electronic musician Ivan Sokolovski, known, inter alia, as a member of the Night Prospect and Center groups.
The music of that period was rich, in addition to Albert Kuwesin's Tuwin throat singing, by electron-industrial elements, and even reminiscent of the music of bands such as Front 242.
After the release of the self-titled album "Yat-Ha", Kuvezin and Sokolovsky's creative ways of doing so differed.
Ivan Sokolovsky released his (processed and updated) version of Yat-Ha's album, entitled Tundraês Ghosts between 1996 and 1997.
Yat-ha at a concert in Frankfurt-on-Main, October 13, 2005
The group was later composed of Kuvesin and other musicians, the only more or less permanent member of which is Evgeny Tkachev.
The music of electronics changed to rock and post-punk.
The group has conducted several world tours, mostly outside Russia.
One of the people in the West with whom the group collaborated was Lou Edmonds, known as a member of the Public Image Ltd.
Since 2001, Yat-ha has also performed live soundtracks for the silent 1928 film "The Gingis-Han Spear of Pudovkin".
In 2002, the band won the BBC Radio 3 World Music Awards in Asia and the Pacific.
In 2005, the band released Re-Covers' cover album with songs from bands such as Joy Division, Iron Butterfly, Kraftwerk, and Albert Kuvezin's throats.
==History==The Young Men's Movement is a political movement in the Ottoman Empire that, since 1876, has tried to carry out liberal reforms and establish a constitutional State structure.
The young Turks succeeded in overthrowing the Sultan Abdul-Hamid II (1908) and carrying out half-day [source not specified for 3433] Western reforms, but after Turkey's defeat in World War I, they gained power.
After Kemal Atatürk's victory, most of the Young Turks actively supported the activities of the Communist People's Republic Party (Cumhuriyat Halk Partisi).
The emergence of the revolutionary situation in Turkey was facilitated by the strengthening of the national liberation struggle of the Balkan peoples at the beginning of the twentieth century and the consequent escalation of the Eastern question, a general revolutionary rise in the East under the influence of the revolution of 1905–2007 in Russia, which began the Asian experiment.
The Young Turkish Revolution and its Consequences
Turkish junior officers
In July 1908, under the leadership of Niyazi-bei, under the leadership of the military officers, an armed rebellion led the Sultan Abdul-Hamid II to re-establish the Constitution of 1876 and to convene a parliament (the 1908 Young Turkish Revolution).
However, in April 1909, a counter-revolutionary mutiny was organized by the Sultan in Istanbul to restore unlimited power.
The attempt failed, and Abdul-Hamid II lost the throne (the Sultanate elected the free Mehmed V), but since then the young Turkeys have changed their minds and have begun to adopt reactionary positions themselves.
Having held ministerial, parliamentary and administrative positions, they had established a dictatorial regime that differed little from the Zulum.

Fearing the new intervention of the Powers (in connection with the national liberation uprisings of the 1870s in Serbia, Herzegovina, Bosnia, Bulgaria and the financial bankruptcy of Turkey), Turkey's "new osmanans" statesman Midhat Pasha, together with some other members of the Government, organized a coup d'état (30 May 1876), which brought the Sultan Abdul-Aziz (rules 1861-1876) to an end, the de facto power was transferred to Midhat Pasha and the cooperating "new osmanas." Sultan Abdul-Hamid II (rules 1876-2009) approved the Midhat Pasha and Namik Kemal draft constitution, and on 23 December 1876 the "Midhat constitution" was solemnly promulgated.
As early as 1877, however, the Sultanate removed Midhat Pasha from the position of great valet, repressed most "new osmans" and dissolved the constitutionally elected parliament in February 1878 and established a self-Power despotic regime ("Zulum").

At the end of the 19th century, the new Osmans became political successors.
Most of the young men were educated in France and elsewhere in Europe.
The Committee &apos; s informal leader was philosopher Abdullaha Jevdet, but he himself did not interfere in politics, mainly in education.
A radical wing, consisting of young officers led by Enver Pasha, Talaat Pasha and Gemal Pasha, emerged among the "merit Turkey".

Two political parties in Azerbaijan are known under the name "Musavat" (azerb.
The early twentieth century party
In 1911, the Muslim Democratic Party Musavat (Equality) was founded in Baku, with former members of the Gummet socialist group at the origin of M. Rasulzade, G. Sharif, A. Kzymzadeh and others.
During the First World War, the leaders of the Musavat party, on the pages of the newspaper Achay with Alz, called on Muslims to lead the war against the Ottoman Empire "to the victory end".
At the same time, Rusulzade defended the Turkic identity ("We are the prisons by language, the prisons by nationality"),[2] but the panturkism was Russian based and rooted in the Islamic modernism of Gasparinsky and meant the turn of the prison "from Makka to Altay".
The Azeri türks were understood to include the Slavans, the Bakinians, the Gyangians, the Irevans, the Borchalians (Georgia) and the residents of north-west Iran.
Prior to the February revolution, Musavat had not demanded the establishment of an independent Turkmen State, confined to the ideals of cultural and national autonomy.
The three principles of Musavat were: Turkism (language), Islamism (religion) and Europe (modernity, progress, time), as reflected in the national Azerbaijani tricolor (blue, green and red).[4]
After the 1917 revolution of February, Musavat, which assumed the dominant position in Azerbaijan under new conditions, advocated the establishment of a "Russian Democratic Republic", while demanding national territorial autonomy for Azerbaijan.
In June 1917, Musavata was merged with the "Turk Federalist Party", the party became known as the "Turk Democratic Muslim Federalist Party", and the party's programme already demanded national territorial autonomy within a democratic Russia.
Kumaki (Kum Kumuklar) is an indigenous people, one of the indigenous peoples of today, Dagestan, Chechnya and North Ossetia.[25][26], the largest people in the northern Caucasus.

Language
The Kumuki speak the Kumuk language, which is part of the Kypchak-Semi-Semi-Cutch subgroup of the Kypchak group, as well as the Oguz group of Turkish languages.
It was a lingua franc in a significant area of the North Caucasus, from Dagestan to Kabarda inclusive, up to and including the 1930s.[181][182][183].
Ethnonym
The origin of the ethnonym "Kumuk" is not clear.
Most researchers (Bakihanov, S. A. Tokarev, A. I. Tamai, S. S. Gajiev et al.) produced the name from the sexy ethnomics of Kimaki or from the other name of the chicks, the kuman.[46]
According to P. K. Uslar, in 19th in the North Caucasus, the term "cumuk" or "cumuk" was referred to as "turcophone" residents of the plain.[47]
In Dagestan, Chechnya and Ingushetia, the term &quot; cumber &quot; and &quot; cumber &quot; was used only to refer to cumbers.[47]
B. A. Alborov derived an ethnonym "Kumuk" from the Turkmen word "Kum" (song, sand desert).
In turn, J. A. Fyodorov, based on written sources from VIII-XIX W., wrote that an ethnonical "gumik-kumuk-kumuk" is an indigenous Dagestan toponym associated with the Middle Ages.[48]
The author of the late 19th century, A. V. Starchevsky, in his dictionary, cited the Kumuk name of the Ariyak cookies; N. I. Marr, in turn, referred to the ethnic tuzley(s) [tüsluler - plains] as a self-name, and according to the testimony of P. K. Uslar in the Cook language, the northern cummies were referred to as "Michihich" [machish] from the name of the border with Chechnya R. Michik[49].

Konstantin Fyodorović Smirnov considered the population of the Kumika plain of the eighth century to be the closest ancestor of the present inhabitants of the country — the Kumaks.[57]
It contains sayings and sayings that are rooted in the existence of the Khazar Kaganata.
In Soviet times, there was a theory of cuisine, like shaky local Montagnats.

Language
The Nogai language is part of the Turkmen language family.
Owing to the broad geographical location of the people, four dialects have historically been distinguished in the Nogai language: the Karanogai (Dagestan, Chechen Republic), the Nogai or Kum (Stavropolsk province), the Aknogai or the Cuban (Karacaevo-Cherkecia), and the Karagash (Astrahan region).
By origin and classification, the Nogai (Kypchak-Nogai) is a steppe dialect of Crimean-Tatar.
Some experts also regard the Nogai language as dialects of the yurt, alabugat and Kundrov Tatars, while others consider them to be Tatar dialects influenced by the Nogai language, and there is a view of the autonomy of these languages.
The literary language is based on the Karanoga dialect and the Nogai talk.

Ulug Hurtuah Tas (book from Hak: The Great Stone Old Lady) is a stone statue near the Aala of Anhakov in Hakasia, a monument to the late Okunevian culture — the beginning of the second millennium B.C.E.
The height is 3.02 metres, and the weight is 2.6 tons.
History
He joined the foundations of the Hakas Republican Museum of Regional Studies in 1954.
It was organized by the Archaeologist of the Hacas Museum of Regional Studies, Albert Nikolaevich Lipsky.
The reason for moving the statue to the museum was to try to protect the work of art from vandalism.
==History==The image of the Hurthui Tas, known to science since 1722, has been used by locals as a special admirer of women's worship and patron of motherhood.
Here's what A. N. Lip's rite of worship of the Hurthui tass describes after she moved to the museum:

A monument to the Tagar culture.
Protected by the State, there is a museum called "The Ancient Kurgans of the Salbik Stepi".
Description
It is located in Salbik, in the Valley of Kings, south of the Batenöw turf, 60 kilometres north-west of Abakan, in the Ust Abakan district of the Republic of Hakassi.
==History==In 1954–1956, the Institute of the History of Material Culture and the Hakas Research Institute of Language, Literature and History, under the leadership of S. V. Kiselev, was discovered.
In 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2008 and 2010, the Saiano-Altai archaeological expedition of the State Ermitage was led by L. S. Marsadolov and conducted comprehensive archaeological and astroarcheological studies of the Greater Salbik Kurgan and the Kingdom Valley in Hakassia.
The height of the mound of the curgan to the digs was 11.5 m, the length of the wall of the stone fence was 71 m. The earth mound was initially 21 m high. By the time the mounds were dug, the mounds had swollen, but kept the shape geometrically correct, because the "collar" of the curgan had been folded out of the wells with a layer of thinly worn clay material.
In the western part of the mound there were pits up to 19 metres in diameter and up to 5 metres deep — traces of 18th - century burglary.
There are 56 curgans within a radius of about 5 km in the Salbik Step, 5 of which are slightly smaller than the Great, and the other 4–6 m high. A characteristic feature of the Salbik group of curgans is the pyramidal form of the embankment, which is particularly visible during morning and evening hours.

Abakan from Mount Samkhwal
Emetology
It appeared in the 1780s as the village of Ust Abakan, a tone from the river's hydronym of the Abakan River, at which the village had its mouth.
In hydronym, two components are identified: aba and a can.
The "baa" component is usually explained from the Serbian aba — the "father", which could have a taboo meaning of "bear"; sometimes the "baa" component is interpreted as an ancient Hakas ethnic one; it has also been suggested that there might be a connection with Iran's ab "water".
The canal component is the common term in the toponymy of South and Central Asia for cana (-cang) to "rea." E. M. Spalova estimates that it is not correct to identify the can with the Evenki souffix of "-can" reduction, also widely represented in Siberia's hydronym.[5]

At that time, as a result of the growing ownership and subjugation of a number of tribes, the Nogai people were also forming.
The Nogai Orda, as an independent state, was finally formed in the 1940s of the 15th century.[1] (by 1440[2]) in connection with the break-up of Ulus Ord-Egen, the vassal state of the eastern wing of the Golden Order.
The Nogai Orda was located in the north-west of the present Kazakhstan and its main territory was in the steppes between Volga and Yaik (Ural).
In the east, the footmen traveled on the left coast of Yaika, in the south-east, in the south, in the south, to the central east, in the west, to the Astrahan sanity, in the north-west, to the Casan sanity, and in the north-east, to the western Siberian lowland.
The capital city of Nogai Orda
The political center of the Nogai Orda was the city of Saraichik, in the town of Yaik (Lower Ural).
The city was founded in the 13th century.
During the existence of the State, the Golden Ord through Sarajczyk followed a lively trade route from Crimea and the Caucasus to Karakorum and China.
The 13th - 12th century was a period of burgeoning of the city, but in the 15th century, Saraichi was destroyed by Tamerlan's forces, and the inhabitants were mostly beaten.
It was only as the capital of the Nogai Ord that the city was reborn.
In 1520, Kazakh Khan Kasim added the city of Saraichik to the Kazakh sanity.
History of the Orda
According to written sources, in the middle of the 15th century, the feet reached the middle of the Syr Darya, taking hold of the strengthened cities.
In 1446, for example, the Mangat Wakas-bius was the ruler of the city of Uzgent on the left coast of Syrdarya, and the descendants of Jedigea, Musa-Mirza and Janburshi (Yamgurchi) played an important role in the political life of the Eastern Dest-e-Kypčak in the fifteenth century.
In 1496, there was a Siberian march to Kazan.

At the beginning of XVI, as a result of the constant strife in the Nogai Ord, there was a decline, and the power of the Khans was severely weakened.
In 1520, Kazakh Khan Kasim captured Saraichi, the capital of the Nogai Orda.
In 1534, Ambassador Daniel Gubin was sent by the Grand Prince of Moscow to Ordu, who provided information about the surrounding lands to Ivan Grozny.
In the first half of the 1550s, as a result of three years of drought and the holodecks in winter, all the cattle fell, an internecine struggle broke out among the legs, followed by an epidemic of plague, 80 percent of the population died, and the legs began to blow to the North Caucasus.

The Golden Orda (also Ulus Juchi — Juchi's Country, or prison).
Ulu Ulus, the Grand State, is a medieval multi-ethnic State on the lands of Central Eurasia, which has brought together many different tribes, peoples and countries.
The boundaries of the Orda are defined by the Arab historian Al-Omari, who lived in the first half of the 14th century:
The borders of that State on the part of Jayhoun — Khorezm, Saganak, Siram, Yarkend, Jand, Sarai, Majar, Azak Qaqa, Akcha Kermen, Kafa, Sudak, Saxin, Ukek, Bulgar, Siberia, Ibir, Bashkird and Chulyman...[26]
Batu Khan, medieval Chinese drawing
Education of Ulus Juchi (Golden Orda)
The division of China's empire between their sons by 1224 can be considered the birth of Ulus Juchi.
After the West Cruise (1236–1222), led by Juchi Batou (in Batoy's Russian record), the ulus expanded westward and became the center of Lower Voljier.
Batou, "Senior of the line" (Aka), supported Hana Munke, probably hoping to gain complete autonomy for his ulouse.
The opponents of the Juchids and the Toluids of the Chagatai and Ugaday descendants were executed, and their confiscated properties were divided between Munke, Batu and other Cheingisids who recognized their authority.
Exclusion from the Mongolian Empire
After Batou's death, his son Sartak, who was in Mongolia at that time, was to become his rightful heir at the court of Munke Khan.
On the way home, however, the new Khan suddenly died.
A young Ulagchi, another son of Batou[28] (the son of Sartak, grandson of Batou[29]), was declared a new Khan, but he died shortly thereafter.
Berke (1257–1266), brother of Batou, was the ruler of the ulouse.
Berke was a young man who converted to Islam, but this seemed to be a political step that did not lead to the Islamization of the broad sections of the nomadic population, which enabled the ruler to gain the support of influential trading interests in the urban centres of Volzhsk Bulgaria and Central Asia, to recruit educated Muslims.
His administration has reached a significant level of urban development, and his cities were built by mosques, minarets, madrasas, caravan-sarayams, particularly Sarai Bat, the capital of the State, which at that time became known as Sarai Berke (disputed identification of Sarai Berke and Saray al-Jedida).[31]
After the conquest of Bulgar, a town in Middle Volgier, it became one of the most important economic and political centres of the ulous.
From 1224 to 1266, he was a member of the Mongol Empire.
The large minaret of the Bulgar Cathedral Mosque, which began shortly after 1236 and was completed at the end of the 13th century[32]
However, this dissatisfaction has not yet been expressed openly.
The bloom of the Golden Ord
During the reign of the Khan of Uzbek (1313–1341) and his son Janibek (1342–1357), the Golden Ord reached its prime, and in the early 1320s, Uzbek Khan proclaimed Islam as a State religion, threatening "unfaithful" physical execution.
The enemies of the Emirs, who did not wish to accept Islam, were severely oppressed, and the time of his sanctification was severe.
The Russian princes, dependent on the Khans, before leaving for the capital of the Golden Order, wrote a spiritual will and fatherly instruction for their children in the event of their death there.
Uzbek built the city of Saray al-Jedid (New Palace), and paid much attention to the development of caravan trade.
The trade routes have become not only safe but also well-established, with Western Europe, Asia Minor, Egypt, India, China and his son Janibek, who is called "good" by the Russian record.
In 1266, Mengou-Timura became fully independent, leaving only a formal dependence on the Imperial Centre.
In the early 1320s, at Uzbek Khan, Islam became the State religion.
The Dissolution of the Golden Ord
Since the 1960s, important political changes in the life of the Golden Ord have taken place since the Great Cloud.
A gradual break-up of the state began, and the rulers of the remote parts of the ulus acquired de facto autonomy, including the independence of the Ulus Orda-Egen in 1361.
Until the 1390s, however, the Golden Orda remained more or less a single state, but with the defeat of the war with Tamerlan and the destruction of the economic centres, the process of disintegration began to accelerate from the 1420s.
In the early 1420s, Siberian sanity was formed, in 1428 Uzbek sanity was formed, followed by Kazan (1438), Crimean sanity (1441), Nogai Orda (1440s) and Kazakh sanity (1465).[39]
After the death of Khan Kichi-Muhammed, the Golden Ord ceased to exist as a single nation.
By the middle of the 15th century, the Golden Orda had fallen into a few separate sanctums; its central part, nominally still the supreme, the Great Ord, ceased to exist in the early 16th century.

The name "Golden Orda" was first used in 1566 in the historical and publicist essay "Kazan History", when the only single State no longer existed.
Until then, the word "Orda" had been used in all Russian sources without the adjective "Golden".
Since the 19th century, the term has been firmly established in the history and is used to refer to the ulius Juchi as a whole or (depending on the context) its western part, with Sarai as its capital.

The State did not have a single name in the gold and eastern (Arabo-persidian) sources themselves. It was usually referred to as the term "ulus", with the addition of an epithet ("Ulug Ulus") or the name of the ruler ("Ulus Berke") and not necessarily the former but also the former ruler ("Uzbek, owner of the Berke countries", "Ambassador Tokhthamishhan, king of the land of Uzbeka").
In addition, the old geographical term Dest-i-Kipchak was frequently used in Arab-each sources.[23]

Founder of the Mangait yurt and dynasty that led the Nogai Ordu.
His direct descendants on the male line were the princes of Urusov, Šejadkov (Shidakov) and Yusuf.
Ediguei, who became a mangay, contributed to the taking of the golden throne by Timur-Kutlug, who, after breaking up Tokhtamish, who fled to Lithuania, soon began to reign on the golden throne.
Meanwhile, the great prince of the Lithuanian Vititt began to prepare a large-scale campaign against the Mongols to restore Tokhtamish to the Golden throne, thereby subjugating the Ord to his political influence.
On his march, Vititt camped on the Worscle River in 1399 (see the Battle of the Worscle River), and Timur-Kutlug, terrified of the many enemies, asked for peace.
In the meantime, with his troops, Jedigei came to the river, who broke the negotiations and convinced Timur-Kutlug to continue the struggle, led by the Lord's troops, Jedigei brought a devastating defeat to Vitita.
Master of the Golden Ord
In 1400, Yediguei staged a coup d &apos; état, killing Timur-Kutlug and placing his younger brother Shadibek in Khan dignity; the latter lived a life of entertainment and did little political interference.
Thus, Jedigeus became the master of the Golden Order.
Jedigei held power firmly in Ord, with his name linked to some rise in international authority and political influence of a broken state, facilitated by the death of Tamerlan in 1405 and the initial turmoil in Maverannahr.
Going to Moscow
There were four royals serving as military commanders and several prominent hordinian emirs.
During the siege of Moscow, Yedigei sent to Trurah the great prince, Ivan Mikhaylovich, a demand to "be on Moscow" with artillery, but he disobeyed it, and after three weeks of unsuccessful siege and receipt of a ransom of 3,000 rubles, Yedigei withdrew from Moscow.
When he entered Moscow, he devastated Serpukhov, Verea, Dmitrov, City, Klin, Nizhny Novgorod and Kolomna, but as a result of the new turmoil in Orda, he burned down the Trinity monastery and destroyed Rizan on the way back.

It's a miniatur from the Faces.
In 1410, Pulad Khan died, and Timur Khan, son of Temir Kutlug Khan, ascended to the throne.
However, as a teacher of Yedigea, Timur Khan soon raised the nomad to the battle against the mighty prison.
At the same time, in 1411, at the very beginning of the struggle, the son of Tokhtamish Jalal Al-Din invaded the Golden Ord with his brothers and looted the holodies.
Origin
In 1419, Ediguei was killed by one of Tokhtamish's sons in the town of Saraichi.
==Early life==Jedigei was born in the family of Beklarbek Baltychak, a family of Mongols, with two sons: Keremet Aziz and Jalal Al-Din.
The latter was Bab Tucles' father, who had four sons.
Based on other sources, Kadyr-Ali-Beck claims that there were three sons, one buried near Caaba, the other in Crimea, and the third in Urgenche.
Further information on the ancestors of Ediga in the lineage given by Kadyr-Ali-Beck is identical to the Crown Princes of Yusupov[6] and Urusov.[7]

The Persian springs of the 15th century call Edige the son of Baltyczak.
Baltychak was a bakerbeck (Amir Al-umara) at the Khan of Timur-Melik's left wing, Beck Urus.
The latter was defeated by Tokhtamish in 1378, and the winner asked Baltychak to join him, but he was proudly refused, so Tokhtamish executed the bakerbec.
In the late 14th and early 15th centuries, Edige's beclairbeck was considered to own ale mangats in the interwealth of Volga, Urala, Emba.
In addition to being an integral part of the Golden Ord, El Mangats were an autonomous entity within Ulus Juchi[11][12].
In the opinion of V. V. Trepavlov, the eastern Kipchaks, who were travelling in the mangut's atom, became Mangats.
In the service of Tamerlan.
The father and older brother of Isa served Urus Khan, and Jedigei was forced to flee for an unknown reason, fleeing Uruz Khan, following the young Tokhtamish, came to the court of Tamerlan, whose army began its service.
She was the wife of Tamerlan, and by the time of Tamerlan's march against Tokhtamish in 1391 was one of the main Emirs (warlords) of the army.
Shortly after the defeat of Tokhtamish Yedigei, together with Timur-Kutlug-Oglan and another Belarusian Emir Kunche-Oglan, asked Tamerlan to release them at home on the pretext of gathering people for the Tamerlan army.
Tamerlan, who believed them, released the military leaders to their home countries, where they began to pursue their own policies (only Kunche-Golan returned).

Also in the Republic of Dagestan (Nogai district), the Omsk region and the Altai province of Russia.
Background
Kipchaki (kipchaki) lived in a vast area from Lake Zaysan on Altay to the banks of the Danube (XI–XII V.), later (after XV in the year) mainly in the territory of modern Central Kazakhstan, on the southern banks of Syrdarya in its middle and lower current, on the banks of Tobola and in the ethnogenis of Kazakhs.
According to the royal census, they settled in Kustanai, Perovsky, Pavlodarsk and Omsk counties.
Their slogan, "Oibas", came from the Khanics of Abulhaira, took an active part in the ethnogenis of the Kazakhs and in the formation of the Kazakh Khan, including the cause of the separation from the Khanics of Abulhair of the Sultans of Janibek and Kerei, which led to the formation of the Kazakh Khany (Kara-Kypshak conflict of Koblanda and Argyna Akjola).
During the years of the Kazakh struggle with Khan Abulhair, the Kythaki were separated from the Koblanda-Batyr, with a marked increase in the Kazakhs, which determined the outcome of the war.
Number
According to the agricultural census of 1899-1912, there were 169,000 people, including 47,000 in the Kustanai county (41% of the Kazakh population), 10,000 in the Omsk district (28%), 14.8% in the Pavlodar district (10.3%), 10.9% in the Akmolin district, 32.9% (22.5%) in the Perovsk region, and 42, 9 (46%).

Going to Moscow
Dmitri Konstantinović, in order to save his land from destruction, sent his sons Vasily Kirdjapa and Semön Dmitrijić to him. Oleg Ivanović, the great prince of Ryazansky, for the same reasons, pointed out to him the brods on Oka. Dmitri Ivanovich Donsky and Vladimir Andreevich Hrabriy, respectively, left for Kostroma and Volok Lamski to gather troops.
The Mitropolitan of Cyprus took refuge in Tver, Tversky Prince Mikhail Alexandrovich sent an ambassador to Tokhtamish with a statement of submission.
Tohthamashki, near Moscow
When Tokhtamoshov took Serpukhov to Moscow, in view of her total helplessness, there was a mutiny, and a Lithuanian prince of Osti came to help the Moscowites.
Two days of Moscow and Lithuanians fought hard, but Tokhtamish took Moscow by scheming to the suburban princes Vasilia Kirdjapu and Semyong Dmitririch, who swore that Tokhtashi would do nothing wrong to Moskwich if they surrendered.
On August 26, Moscow surrendered, but the promise was not fulfilled: many people were beaten and the city was looted, followed by the Tatars taking Peryaslav, Vladimir, Yuriev, Zvenigorod, Mojajsk and other suburban cities.
Dmitry Donsky's successor, his son Vasily I Dmitrievich, bought a label in Ord for the Nizhegorodian Princess.
Fighting Tamerlan
The Tatars also raided Russian soil several times, looted Ryazan, but couldn't make a big and serious march against Moscow by fighting Timur (Tamerlan), to whom he had been responsible for the throne.
Fearing the transition of Zakawkaz and Western Iran to enemy power, Tokhtamishi invaded the region in 1385.
In the 1390s, Timur inflicted two brutal defeats on the Khan, on Kondurch (1391) and Terek (1395), after which Tokhtamish lost his throne and was forced to fight against the Khans who had been set up by Timur.
After the defeat, Tokhtamish appears to have managed to seize power for a short period of time in the Siberian sanctification or part of its hives.[9]
Coming to power
Death of Tokhtamish
Chinghisid Tokhtashish was the son of Tui Hoji, the ruler of Mangashalak, and the powerful hanzada of Urus Khan.
After Tui Hoja was executed on the order of Urus Khan for disobedience, young Tokhtamash, fearing for his life, fled to Samarkand in 1376 to see the ruler Maverannahrah Timur (Tamerlan).
In 1377, Tokhtamesh, with the support of Timur, began to conquer the Golden Order.
However, in the first battle, despite the death of King Kutlug-Bugi of Belarus, son of Urus Khan, Tokhtamesh was defeated and fled to Timur.
Soon, he was led by a stronger army from Timur, and again invaded the Golden Ord.
However, he was again smashed by the son of Urus Khan Toktake and took refuge in Timur.
Uruz Khan demanded that the Emir be handed over to him by the threat of war, but Timur refused.

Toktamashi is the son of Tui-hodji, the son of Kutluk-hodji, the son of Kunček, the son of Sariči, the son of Uran-Timour, the son of Tuk-Timur, the son of Juchi.
The wives of Toktamisha: Tagai-bike; Shukr-bika-aga is the daughter of Amir Arsaka; Urun-bike;
Toktamesh Khan had eight sons and five daughters:
Timur himself began to prepare for the Golden Orda against Urus Khan, and soon invaded it and settled at the Segnac in front of the Urus Khan troops.
However, because of the powerful frosts, the warriors were unable to hold arms, and Tamerlan postponed the conquest of the Orda until spring.
The following year, there was no decisive confrontation again, as Urus Khan died suddenly.
After the short reign of Toktaki, Timur-Malik took over the throne.
Tohthamesh, the head of the army assigned to him by Timur, invaded Orda, but was once again defeated, barely avoiding death.
In view of the many vices and weaknesses of Timur Malik, Timur quickly lost power, making it possible for Tokhtamish to be sent back to subjugation of the Lord's throne. Tokhtamish defeated Timur Malik and became the ruler of the White Ord with the center in Sygnac.
Gold Orda in 1389
In the spring of 1378, after the fall of the eastern part with the capital in Sygnak, Tokhtamish invaded the western part controlled by Mamai.
By April 1380, Tokhtamesh was able to capture the entire Golden Ord down to Azov, including the capital, Sarai Berke.
After the Battle of Kulikovsky, Tokhtaši, with the help of Timur, took over the throne of the united Golden Order, in the Battle of Kalka in 1380, by dividing the remnants of the baklarbek Mamay, who suffered heavy losses after the Culikov battle.
The following two years, Rusie and Orda existed as two separate states.
Wak.
Huh () is one of the six tribes of the so-called Middle Ordu (Korta, Wak, Kerry, Argyn, Kipchak, and Recruited) Kazakhs.
Wak is the smallest tribe of the Middle Ord.
The cattle were at the mouth of the Irtysh River, and during the Jungar and Kalmitz wars, the family line was in the way of the jungle and Kalmak invasion, causing the greatest losses, but this resulted in the largest number of wachy bats.
Origin
As noted above, Wak is a tribe of kin to the kereess.
Researchers believe that the relationship between wak and kerea is beyond doubt.[4]
In historical literature, it is the prevailing view that the Kerei tribe originates from medieval Cereites.

Wak is a noble generation, and the Wak warriors were considered to be among the best in the Kazakh sanity.
The famous Batras — Bayan, Jer-Kokshe, and Jer-Kosai, Koshkarbay, and Derpsala — came out of this family.
The fact is that when asked by Ablay, who is more respectable by the Baty of all 3rds, he answers: "Two men before me deserve to be surprised: Kozibek Karakisekowec, who returned 90 of his prisoners from Galdan and Derisalah Wakowec, who also returned his prisoners. The first one took the request and was himself with Galdan, and the last one feared the enemy sitting in his aul.
Of my boots, the Basentinian Malai Sara, by wealth, courage and character, and the Wakowec Bayan, by reason of reason and courage, are above all...'[1] So out of the four most worthy bowels, Ablai Khan thinks two are members of the Wak family, despite their small numbers.
To date, the Wak family has been settled in the Pavlodar, East Kazakhstan, North Kazakhstan, Kostanai regions of the RK, and some of the Waks also live in Altai province, Mongolia and China, and in Germany.

Tobacco is included by researchers among the tribal groups associated with the Mongols in the past.[1] The ethnic relationship of the Tabanas to the Mongols, as noted by N. V. Bikbulatov, is found from a variety of different sources.
A number of researchers support the Mongolian theory of Taban origin and identify them with Mongolian Tawnanguts and Buryat Tabanguts.[3]

According to some researchers, the word "tabanu" is used to worship, according to others, the Mongol Five (Tabun) is often used in Turkmen-Thurco ethnonymicals.
An analysis of the Taban tangs (they still have in-born tamps) shows their great resemblance to the tangs of the Senior Juz, especially the dulatian ones. It is no accident that the Kazakh Taban tabuns' bashkirs are considered to be one of the "proditioners" by the legendary Mike Bius, an ethnicist of the Senior Buzz, which includes dulats.
The Mongol conquest of the Seven (1218) took part of the dulats to the west, where a new alliance of five dulu tribes was formed, named in the Mongolian version of Taboun. In XVI–XVII, the alliance divided into Kazakh and Baschir taboos, which included various components but preserved the overall pattern of the tambs and the genealogy of the Mike Biya.

The Siberian shrine (the Siberian kingdom, the Siberian yurt[2]) is a Buddhist state in Western Siberia formed at the end of the fifteenth century by the dissolution of the Golden Ord.[4]
Siberian sanity was bordered on Perm Land, Nogai Orda, Kazakh Khanism, and TVs, and in the north it reached the lowlands of Obi, and in the east it was next door to Pega Orda.

Vilayat Chingi-Tura (1375–1468)
In 1359, the Golden Ord began the Great Stain, in which the Swanians take an active part.
It's Tokhtamish time.
According to Chingiz Name, King Tokhtashi, who was first defeated by Uruz Khan and his descendants, sought the help of the head of Shibanid Kaganbek's family, Kaganbek did not assist Tokhtamish, but the help came from Kaganbek's cousin, Arab Shah.
Thanks to the latter, both Urushanid and Mama were able to win, for the first time since the start of the Great Shadow, by uniting the Golden Ord.
As a thank you, Tokhtamesh handed over to Arab Shah power over Ulus Shiban.[27]
Political history
As previously reported, the Arab Shah and his brother were travelling between the tops of Yaik in the summer and the mouth of Syrdarya in the winter, the first strikes by Tamerlan on Tokhtamish were on Ulus Shiban, Nizam al-Din Shami in which Tamerlan sent Jahan-Shah-Bahadur, Omar-Bahadur and Uch Kara-Bahadur "to the side of Irtysh in search of the enemy".
Hadji-Muhammad State (1421-1428)
An analysis of the Recordbook and the Siberian record shows that the founder of the Siberian Khan was the descendant of Shaiban Haji-Muhammed, who was proclaimed Khan Siberia in 1420.
Then, in the sanctuaries, a long-standing internecine struggle broke out, ending only in 1495 with the proclamation of the city of Siberia (Kashalik) as the capital of the State.
Tumen sanity at Ibak Khan
Origins (1220 - 1375)
Perhaps for the first time, the term Siberia is mentioned in a 1240 Mongols "Unan-Chao Mi-shi" which refers to Juchi's conquest of forest tribes south of Shibir in 1206.
At the same time, researchers are not sure how to locate this area; it is suggested that "may be called the northern edge of the Barabine plane between Obyu and Irtysh" (Palladius).[6]
You can identify with the Tobolo-Irtishian interspecies of Siberia and Ibir, mentioned in the first half of the 14th century as part of the Golden Order by the secretary of the Egyptian Sultan Al-Omari.[7]
In the same century, cities of the future Siberian sanity are found on Western European maps: Cashlyk in the form of Sebur appears in the map of the Venetian brothers Pizzigani (1367),[8] while Chingi-Tura in the shape of Singui appears in the Catalan Atlas (1375).[9]

The largest birth of the alimula is the shekel and the cake.
A large number of Skeleton alimuls are associated with the Bulgar Kipchaks by scientists such as A. Konyratbaev, O. Smirnova.
The book Diouani Lugat al-Turk refers to the Shekta tribe living on the Chu River.
It is also known that the schomeces, karakes, the keta, related to the almulah, were part of the Western Turki kaganat.
For two centuries (550–740) on the banks of the Chu River, they formed the core of the Western Turk State, and between 742–744 Uighurs and dwarfs were cut into two parts, most of which fled west, the smaller part of which went through the mountains to Kashgaria.
The Kazakh group lived all the time in the lowlands of the Syr Darya River and east of the Aral Sea, all of which point to the ancient history of the tribe.

Notes
The closest family of Kazakhs to the body is the Karakalpak muyten tribe (co-founders of the famous popular epic of 40 Amazon girls), which has a kind of body and a samurai.
Origin
The television is traditionally considered to be the descendants of ancient Tunisian-speaking telemen[1][2] (dinlin, Gauguy).[3]
In ethnogenetic terms, the ancient tribes of the body are compared by L. P. Potapov with televisions, telexes and teles.
The body itself goes up to the TV.[1]
There is also a view of the Mongolian origin of the body's tribes.
According to N. I. Bichirin, the dinlins (dili)[4] and Googhui were of Mongol origin.
In his view, the Googhui were first called dili and later called Googhu dinlins.[5]
A. S. Shabalov believes that the teleuts[6] and their predecessors dili and Googhuy originally spoke Mongolian varieties.[6][7]

Before the revolution of 1917, the population was 20,000.
In June 1370, Khan Abdullah died.
An eight-year-old, Mohammed Bulak (Bulek, also in Russian record, Magometh-Sultan) of the Batouid family, was declared a new Khan, who remained a Khan of the self-proclaimed Mamaeva Orda until 1380 and died in the Battle of Kulikow.
Mamay's relationship with Moscow was very contradictory and volatile.
At the beginning of his reign, Mama supported Moscow.
In 1363, he was concluded before the end of the treaty on the reduction of the dowry charged by the Prince of Moscow.
There is also a theory that before this, Mama helped to free the mytropolitan Alexius from being imprisoned in Lithuania, where the latter was in 1358–1359.
In 1363, Mama branded a young Moscow prince, Dmitri, who thus recognized his dependence on Mamai and his valet, the Khan Abdullah, and not the legitimate Khans of Sarai (in the eyes of Yasa Chinghishan-based Golden Ord law, all of Mama's Han were impostors).
However, in 1370, Mamai's prison took Dmitri's great eminence and handed it over to Michael Tversky.
However, as early as 1371, Dmitri personally arrived in Mamaeva Ordu (Mamai's self-proclaimed part of the Golden Orda during the internecine war) and eventually received a label from Mamai's new Khan, Mohammed Bulak, to mark the great princeship.
Combating Tokhtamish
In 1377, Cheingisid Tokhtashish, with the support of Tamerlan's troops, began a campaign to establish his power in the Golden Ord.
In the spring of 1378, after the fall of the eastern part of the State (the Blue Orda) with its capital in Sygnak, Tokhtamash invaded the western part (the White Ordu) controlled by Mamai.
By April 1380, Tokhtamesh was able to capture the entire Golden Ord down to the North Prizia, including the city of Azak (Azov).
Mother's control was limited to his native male steppes, the North Primory and Crimea.
But as a result of the war with Khan Tokhtamish, supported by Tamerlan, Mama's next blow to Russi did not take place.
Later, in October or November 1380, a decisive battle took place between the troops of Mamai and Tokhtamish.
The historian V. G. Lyskoronsky suggested that this battle "on Kalkah" took place in the vicinity of small rivers, the left tributaries of the Dniepra near the threshold.[5]
From 1361 to 1380, during the "Great Shadow" (long-term internecine war in the Golden Ord), on behalf of the puppet Khans of the Batouid dynasty, he ruled the western part (also the capital) of the Golden Ord.
Death
After his defeat from the troops of Tokhtamysha, Mama fled to Kafu (now Feodosia), where he had long-standing ties and political support for the Genoa, but was prevented from entering the city and tried to enter Solhat (now Old Crimea), but was intercepted by Tokhtamish's trips and killed.
He is believed to have been killed as mercenaries by order of the Khan.

Origin
It was born around the threshold of 1320–130 and, according to the researchers, was the same age and friend of the childhood of Khan Berdibek, who ruled between 1357 and 1359, with the death of which the legal Batouid dynasty on the throne of the Golden Ord began and the era of the Great Shadow began until 1380.
He used the Muslim name Kichig-Muhammad.
He was married to Berdibek's daughter, Toulunbek Khanum.
Throughout the period of the Great Castle, Mama sought to return the Batouid dynasty to the general throne, and in his part of the Ordah made the hank of representatives of that dynasty.
For baklarbec
Since the second half of the 1350s, Mama has become the viceroy of Crimea and the North Primordial.
Since 1357, Berdibek has held the position of baklarbek, one of the two principals in the Golden Order administration.
He was responsible for the administration of the army, external affairs and the Supreme Court.
Head of the ulouse
After the murder of Berdibek Khan Kulpei in 1359, Mama declared war on him.
In Ord, the so-called "Great Scatter" began.
Because the beclairbec was not a chingizid and could not be officially Khan, in August 1361, Mama declared the Khan of the White Orda to be his lieutenant Abdullah of the Batouids, but other candidates for power in the Golden Ord opposed it.
Between 1359 and 1370, Mama was forced to fight nine hans with variable success.
By 1366, he had managed to take control of the western part of the State (from Crimea to the right bank of Volga), thereby weakening central authority.
At times, during the period of "Great Castle" (1363, 1367-1368, 1372-1373), Mama managed to take possession of the capital, Sarai, on the left bank of Volga.
Without any support among the Eastern Hanics, Mama's foreign policy was based on convergence with the European states of Genoa, the Grand Prince of Lithuania, Venice and a number of others.[The source has not been listed for 852 days.]
Mamay (c. 1335, Solhat (Old Crimea)[1] - 1380, Kafa) was a baker and dungeon of the Golden Ord.
Saint Alexius heals the hansha Tadula, Yakov Kapkov (1816-54).
In 1357, Janibek won the city of Tauris[1] and joined the Golden Orde in the Azerbaijani land.
According to Russian records, in 1357, a severely ill Hansha Taidula, Janibek's mother, called the Mytropolite Alexia to Orda in the hope of healing him with prayers, during which time Khan Janibek, who had returned from Percy, was also ill, but was not allowed to visit him, but these events are not confirmed by other sources.
The eldest son of Berdibek, after learning of his father's illness, left Azerbaijan and went to Sarai with all the troops.
According to this Russian source, the supporters of Khan Berdibek also killed 12 of his brothers, thus making Berdibek the sole legitimate heir to the golden throne.[4][5]

Orda (film)
Janibeck () is the third son of Uzbek Khan and the han of the Golden Orda (1342 - 1357).
As a result of the successful war with the Chadian Persians, Azerbaijan joined, bringing the Golden Orda to its maximum size, including the Western Siberia, the Bulgar Ulus (Mednier Pololzhier), the White Ordu (Kazakhstan, Khorezm), the Blue Ordu (Cuban, Don, Crimea), the Caucasus Ulus (including Azerbaijan); some territories of Rusi were also politically dependent.
Biography
Janibek came to power as a result of the killing of his brothers, Khan Tinibek (official heir to the throne) and Hyzir.
He pursued a policy of strengthening central authority and interfering in the affairs of the mustered princes.
However, Janibek was called "good" in the Russian record.
In 1347, the only raid on Rus was in the vicinity of the city of Aleksina.[2]
Janibek's board had been accompanied from the outset by a complication of the foreign policy environment.
Already in 1343, Janibek began a war against Italian colonies in Crimea, Venetian in Tan and Genoa in Caffa.
In 1345, the Venetians and Genoa, after receiving the blessing of Pope Clement VI of Rome, declared a crusade against Janibek.
However, as the pressure of the Goldordian troops worsened the situation of the colonies and resulted in losses of trade, the march failed and the Italians had to make peace with Janibek.[3]
The situation on the western border was far less successful.
In 1344, Polish King Kazimir III began a war for the lands of Galicko-Volynsk Rusi, and by the end of the 1340s took most of those lands from Juchids.
Several other south-west Goldland territories were seized by the Lithuanian Prince Olgerd.[1]
Failures at the western borders of the country have led to a fall in the eastern hives of other Juchid lines.
Chimtai, the ruler of the White Order, became the virtually independent ruler who prepared her rise under Urus Khan.
In addition, Swanyanid Insan-han began a chaecan of his own coin, which was the prerogative of the sovereign ruler.[1]
In 1348, the Lithuanian prince Olgerd, who sought to strengthen Lithuanian influence on the Russian lands, sent his brother Koriath to Janibek to demand help, but the Khan, inspired by the Moscow Prince Simeon Gordgo, gave him Koriat along with other Lithuanian ambassadors.
On the death of Simeon, Janibek placed the Moscow Prince Ivan II, the brother of Simeon, on the great princeship, while the City and Susdal confirmed the son of the Susdal Prince Konstantin Vasiljevic, Andrei. In 1355, Janibek tried Prince Yuri Jaroslavić of Muromsky with his relative Fyodor Glebovich and gave him not only to the Prince but also to Yuri himself.[1]

In 1357, after Janibek's death, his son came to power, and his grandson, Tydula, Berdibek, joined him, as did his father, Tidiula, in ruling the power.
It is known that it was trying a lawsuit between the gold merchant and the Venetian merchant who robbed and captured the merchant.
Berdibek was overthrown and killed in a coup d'état in 1359 by Kulpea (Kulna), who fought him for power.
R. Y. Pochaev reports that she first considered the candidature of Swananid Hyzra in search of a suitable Khan, but then leaned towards Muhammad Nauruzbek.
Tidula, Tidulu, Titugly Hatun (m. 1361) is the wife of the Khan of the Golden Order of Uzbeck, the mother of his sons Tinibek and Janibek, as well as his daughter, who was married to Harunbek, the son of the ruler Horesm Kutlug-Timour.
First marriage
Tidula became Uzbek Khan &apos; s eldest wife, following the death of his wife Bayalun in 1323, according to the Simeon Book. R. Y. Pocheva Baialun fled from Khan to Constantinople to her father, Emperor Andronic II.
According to Ibn-Battuth, her preference for Uzbek was related to a physiological characteristic: "Sultan loves her for one characteristic of hers, which (is) that every night he finds her as a virgin."
==Death==The eldest son and heir of Uzbek Timur died in his father's life in 1330.
Tidula's children competed for inheritance.
Tidula Tinibek, the eldest son, enjoyed the favor of his father and was given positions of responsibility, one of which was the viceroy in Khorezm.
However, he did not like his father at the post, and from 1339 to 1340, gold coins of the Golden Ord were chewed with the names of Uzbek and Janibek, and diplomatic letters mentioned Uzbek, Tidula and Janibek.
After the death of Uzbek Khan,
When Khan Uzbek died in 1341, power in the capital was in the hands of Janibek and Tydula, who fully supported the youngest son.
Despite this, the top of the Orda did not go against the law and proclaimed the Khan of Tinybek, who was in Khorezm.
However, even before Tinibek arrived in Sarai Janibek and Tidula, they were able to kill a possible rival, Hizrbek, son of Uzbek, from another wife.
The murder of Hizrbek caused Tinibek to want to punish Janibek, but he gathered enough supporters with his mother's help.
As a result of the internecine struggle, Tinibek died in unclear circumstances, and Janibek became Khan since 1342.
Tidula also received substantial sources of income as gifts from her youngest son, including Tula, who was run by her bascats, and some of the trading fees in Azov.
Janibek and his mother had a difficult policy regarding the Russian clergy.
Janibek, contrary to Mongol customs, taxed the church with certain taxes, and apparently in 1347 gave Sarai Bishop John a certificate confirming the independence of the church court from the princess.
In 1357, Khan Janibek, returning from the conquest of Azerbaijan, was seriously ill, and modern researchers believe that Tydula called for his treatment by the mythpoliticist Alexius, who was famous for the art of treatment but failed to cure the Khan.
Thadula used her illness as an excuse to challenge her illness because she could not disclose the disease to the Khan itself.
According to Russian sources, her message indicates that Alexi went to treat hansha's eye disease and cured her.
In 1365, he founded a monastery in the Moscow Cremle of the Miracles, in memory of the wonderful healing of Tidal's blindness.[2]
Muhammad Berdibek Khan (1310 - 1359) was the eighth han of the Golden Order (1357 - 1359), son and successor of Janibek.

Under the command of Janibek, he took part in a conquering march to Azerbaijan in 1356.
After completing his tour, he was left to rule in Tebriz, but after receiving information about Janibek's illness, he returned to Ordu to take part in the power struggle.
He came to power in the summer or autumn of 1357.
According to Persian and Tartar sources, Berdibek's father, Janibek, died of a severe illness after going to Percy, and Berdibek, a Russian source, staged a plot that led to the murder of his seriously ill father.
Immediately after taking office, Berdibek ordered the physical destruction of all members of the Batu Khan family who might have been his real or potential competitors.
A total of 12 of his relatives were killed, including an 8-month-old brother (the Arab author, Muin Al-Din Nathanzi, killed him by hitting the ground).
Berdibek gave Russian mitropolitics Alexia a label (applied by a certificate) confirming that the Russian Church had been freed from danish and wrestling.
In 1358, he labeled the Venetian Ambassadors Giovanni Quirini and Francesco Bona, confirming the right of the merchant from Venice to reside and trade in Azov and Provato (Buchta Two-Acorn) and allowing these merchants to trade in the Crimean ports of Kalitra, or Caliere (Cockebel), and Soldaye (Sudak).
According to the Arab author, Ibn Haldun, Mamai was one of the senior administrative posts in the bakers &apos; court of Berdibek.

With Berdibek, his closest companion, Tuglou-bai (known as Tovlubius in Russian writings), died, playing a key role in his coming to power.
Berdibek's death was the beginning of years of confusion in Ord, which Russian recorders called "the great castle." In the icon of Dionya's workshop, "Mitropolitan Alexi With Lives"[1] was portrayed by Berdibek two years before his death in 1357 as the world's world politician Alexius, who came to Ordu.[2]

The reign of Uzbek was supported by Islamic supporters.
The nomination was preceded by a lively struggle, as nomads wanted to have a successor to Tohta, a supporter of traditional order and Tengrianism, on the throne of Jordan.
As a result, Uzbek, who took the throne with the support of the pro-Islamic forces, had to spend eight years in the northern part of Dest-i-Kipchak.
In January 1313 he took up the throne, and in 1320 (1321) he officially accepted Islam from the descendant Bab Arslan Zangi-Ata and his successor, Seid-Ata. Bab Arslan was the mentor of Ahmed Yasawi, a major soupee, an ideology among the Turkic tribes.
Board
Uzbek Khan firmly held power in his hands and brutally cut off all separatist activities on the outskirts.
He abolished the Russian bass, passing the right to collect and send it to the Russian princes in Orda.
Uzbek Khan managed to eliminate the internal strife in Orda and get her up.
In the early 14th century, the Khan carried out a major administrative and territorial reform whereby the right wing of Ulus Juchi was divided into four major ulius: Sarai, Khorezm, Crimea and Dest-i-Kypchak, headed by the Khan-appointed Ulusbecs Emirs (Ulusbecs), resulting in a more rigid vertical power structure, which ensured him an unstoppable submission to Voljya, Khorezm, Crimea and Kipchak Step.
Uzbek's board was the time of the greatest power of the Golden Order.
The Russian record is known as Alabuga, Azbyak, Ozbiak.
Identity
After the death of Uzbek in 1341, his son Tinibek was given short-term power in the Golden Ord.

The taking of power and the affirmation of Islam
Uzbek Khan was a nephew of Khan Tohte and a grandson of Khan Meng-Timur.
The son of Tohta Ixar (Ilbasar, Ilbasmaš) was declared a Khan by the omier Emir Kadak, and Kadak became the main Visir.
But in January 1313 Uzbek, along with the bakerbec Kutlug-Timur, came from Urgench to tell the loved ones of the late Khan Tohta the words of comfort, killed Ixar and Kadak, after which, with the support of Kutlug-Timur and his father's wife Baialun, Uzbek took power in Golden Orde.

When Urus Khan returned to Sarai Berkah, Mamaya Bullak Khan's valet was already in charge, and in June 1375 Uruz Khan returned to the shrine of the Golden Order.
Soon after, however, Bullak Khan was able to win back Sarai Berke and drive Urus Khan to Sygnac.
In 1377, Tamerlan joined the battle against Urus Khan, but the armed conflict between them did not take place because of the sudden death of Urus Khan.
According to Chingiz-name, he was killed by Tokhtamish's son, Jalal Al-Din, during the battle.
Uruz Khan/Alasha Khan ratio
Some Kazakh historians, in particular Radik Temirgaliev, identify Uruz Khan and Alasha Khan as one person.[2]
The Kazakh Khans have traditionally expressed their origins from Urus Khan.
The great-grandson of Urus Khan, son of Toktaki Kerei Khan, along with another descendant of Urus Khan, a great-grandson of Koirić Khan's son and the son of his grandson, Barak Khan, Abu Said, called Janibek Khan, became the founders of the Kazakh Khan.

The Blue Orda (Kok Orda) is the eastern part or left wing of the Golden Ord (Golden Ord), located in western Siberia and Kazakhstan.
The problem of the relationship between the concepts of Kok Orda and Acca Orda
One of the parts of the eastern wing of the Golden Order
In Kazakhstan, the third point of view is generally accepted, according to which the division into Ak and Kok Ordu refers only to the eastern part of Juchi's hulus.

T. 1. Kazan: Int Tat. Enz., 2002.
Cuzembayula A., Adil E. History of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Astana, 2002.
There is no consensus in the history of what is meant by this term, as medieval sources contain contradictory indications.
The terms Ak-Orda, Kok-Orda and Ulus Juchi are found in Muslim sources (Arabic, Persian, Turkian) and each of the terms coincides with or overlaps with the Golden Order, and it is difficult to establish clear boundaries [2]
The eastern part of the Golden Order
According to a traditional view that is common in Russia and that goes up to Russian records, Kok-Orda refers to the eastern part of the Golden Order, according to the Greeks B.D., Yakubovsky A. Y. and Fedorov-Davadova G.A.[3], who were vascularly dependent [4] on Batya's older brother, Ordu Ichen.[5] After the suppression of Batya dynasty in the 1360s during the Great Zamitni, power in both parts of Orda was transferred to eastern Juchidam.
In the Russian record, the Blue Ord is located east of the Volga and is mentioned twice: for the first time in connection with the Shadow that ended with the reign of Tokhtamish ("the king from the east, the name of Tokhthamash, from the Blue Ord), the second in connection with the invasion of Timur in 1395.
West Golden Ord
Less popular is the opposite view that Kok-Orda, on the contrary, corresponds to the western part of Juchi's ulus.
After the story of the reign of the Golden Khan of Tochta (1291–1312), this piece states:

Kuchum, Kuchum Khan (Kybtat, Kt. Küxem, Kxh, 16th century, 1601) was a Siberian Khan (Kingis Khan) from the Shibanid dynasty, and Ibak's grandson, Khan Tümeni and Grand Orda.
At Kuchum &apos; s request, the ruler of Bouhara, Shabanid Abdullah-han II, sent Kuchuma three times with the Bukhar riders of sheikhs and Seids to preach Islam.

Kuchum's escape from Isker.

After finally taking over the Sibir sanity, Kuchum first continued to pay Yasak and sent his ambassador to Moscow with 1,000 sobs (1571), but when his wars with the former Siberian owners ended, he approached Permi.
His appearance triggered an attempt by the Noga Tatars to separate themselves from Moscow and the Cheremis riot.
Several further marches by his troops into the possession of Ivan Grozny and Stroganov resulted in their loss of power in the Siberian sanity.
Most importantly, Kuchum did not have much experienced troops, his guards and Ulans, recruited in the southern steppes and reinforced by local Siberian Tatars, were relatively poorly armed, using outdated tactics and weapons.
It was difficult for them to resist military-trained Cossacks and foreign mercenaries, most of whom used firearms, high-quality protective armor and had the most advanced fighting techniques.
Kuchum, who fled to the Ishimi steppes, began to raise foreigners, followed Ermak all the time, and finally, on 6 (16) August 1585, attacked him by surprise, and smashed his unit.
Continued resistance: Relations with neighbours
In 1586 the Voivodes Vasily Sukin and Ivan Meat were sent to Siberia.
The following year, Daniel Chulkov's head arrived in Siberia with a crew of shooters.
The sanctification forces were undermined by internecine struggles.
Sedidk (Seid Khan), Kuchum's rival, expelled his sons from Isker, but in 1588 he was himself captured by Danil Culkov.
On July 8, 1591, Prince Vladimir Vasiljević Koltsov-Mosalski took the voivode march, and on August 1 (11), he attacked the Khan on the River Ishimé, near Lake Chilekula, that after a brief battle many of the Khan &apos; s ex-wives were killed and the survivors fled.
King Abdul-Hair and the two wives of Khan with many other prisoners were to follow Russians who had returned with rich prey to Tobolsk in full victory.
Origin
In 1597, Kuchum proposed peace, subject to the return of the lands of Irtysh and the release of Shaim and two other guests who had been sent to Kuchum by the ambassadors, and asked for the return of the cannon from their belongings.
A bunch of people didn't sign up.

On 9 May 1598, Vojvodov Andrei Matveevich Voeykov and Vojvodov, Prince Ivan Vladimirovich Koltsov-Mosalski, marched with 700 Russians and 300 Tatars. On 4 (14) August 1598, Vojkov came from Tara; he was made up of 300 Cossacks, 30 Tartars, 60 Tartar Horsemen,[6] and attacked the Khan in his camp, in the Irmen fighting on 20 (30 August 1598), killing numerous Tatars.
A brother, son and two grandchildren of Kuchum were killed, most of the Khan's guards were killed, and the Khan was able to escape after Obya. The Russians returned to Tara on 23 August (2 September).
The famous prisoners were sent from Tara to Tobolsk and from there to Moscow on the occasion of a brilliant victory in Siberia, and a grateful prayer was served in Moscow.
Kuchum died of violent death among one of these peoples, one of the places of death being the Tengiz-Curgalgin Fall.
Kuchum's son, Kuchum Ali, was probably killed in 1601.
Family
It is known that Khan Kuchum had several wives:
The daughter of Murat, a candidate for the throne of the Kazakh Khan, was the daughter of the Murza Devlet Baya, and her residence was in the same area as her father's, namely in Biziktur, Panin Bougra Suzga Hanim, and her residence was on the high bank of Irtysh, 6 versts below Tobolsk (Susgun Cape), daughter Shigai Khan, mother of Kanay and Azim Saltan Suijdejan Yandevlet (Jandaulat) Actulum (Actolyn) Ak-Suyrun (Axorek) Shevel (Shegally) Kubol (Chubli) Chepshan (Chebechan)

He was a descendant of Genghis Khan.
Kuchum was a relative of the ruling Swanani dynasty in the Bukhar sanity, and Han belonged to the family of the Shibanids, the descendants of Shiban, the fifth son of Juchi, and his grandson Jingishan.
Some legends recorded by historians say that Kuchum was from Bukhara.
Commencement
With the support of his relative, Swananid, Bukhar Khan Abdullah Khan II, Kuchum fought for a long time (in 1555) and fought hard against the Siberian Khan Jediger using an army of Nogai, Kazakh troops.
He won a decisive victory in 1563.
Before God destroyed his kingdom and gave it to Orthodox Christians, King Kuchum had ruled freely and peacefully in Siberia for many years."
The people of the Siberian sanctum, based on the Tatars and their mensi and hants, regarded Kucuma as a usurper, especially since it was supported by an alien army, and other Siberian records say that Sejadk, after the death of his father and uncle, ruled in Siberia until he came from the Kazakh Steppes of Kuchum, who took the city and forced Sejdka to flee to Buhara.
And many of those who did not want to be cut by the law were forced to do so by force, and some of those who opposed it were executed.
The introduction of a new faith was accompanied by numerous popular rebellions, and Kuchum sought the help of his father Murtaza, who sent a large army to Kucuma.
The Siberian-Tatar language (samonance: Tatars,[5] Tatars,[6] tartar tartars of the body[7]) is the language of the Siberian Tatars.[2] The classification of the language is the subject of discussion.
A number of researchers consider it to be an independent Turkmen language.
Other researchers consider it the eastern dialect of the Tatar language[8][9][10] or the eastern group of Tatar dialects[11][12][13].
The first attempts at scientific understanding of the Siberian-Tatar language date back to the end of the eighteenth century.
The interest in the language of the Siberian Tatars is heightened by the need to train missionary staff in the conversion of the Siberian Tatars to Christianity.
At the end of XVIII (1783), the teaching of the Siberian Tatar language was introduced.
This is probably one of the reasons for the rejection by the Siberian Tatars of the written form of their mother tongue, as it became a Christian language in this regard, which was naturally perceived negatively by the Muslim population.[The source has not been indicated for 1,346 days.]
In 1802, St. Petersburg published the "Bukwaar of the Arab and Tatar letter" of a teacher at the Sauska School of Niyat-Baki Atnometov as a teaching aid for students in the elementary classes of the Siberian Tatar schools.[20]
The value of this book is that it was the first attempt to produce a textbook in the native language of the Siberian Tatars.
It is divided into three large dialects: Tobolo-Yrtish, Barabinski and Tomb.
Classification of B. V. Radlova
Eastern Group: languages and dialects of the Altay, Osko, Yenisian Turoq and Culum Tatars, Karagas, Hakas, Shore and Tuvin languages; Western Group: Tatars of Western Siberia, Kyrgyz, Kazakh, Bashkir, Tartar and, conditionally, Karakalpak languages; Central Asian Group: Uighur and Uzbek languages; South Group: Turkmen, Azerbaijani, Turkish, some South Coastal Ghors of Crimean-Tatar; Yakut Language Special.[15]

According to a traditional view that is common in Russia and that goes up to the Russian record, Ak-Orda is the western part of the Golden Order, run by Batya and his descendants, the Juchids of the right wing.[1]
That is, the White Orda is defined as the Golden Ord in a narrow sense, like the senior uluce, run by the hanks from Sarai, which was the source of Rusie.
After the ban on Batya dynasty in the 1360s, during the Great Mintni, power was transferred to eastern Juchidam (Blue Orda), the descendants of Batya's brother Shiban.
Some historians believe that the White Ord is, on the contrary, the eastern part of Juchi's ulius, and Blue Ord's the western part.[2]
In Kazakhstan, a third view is common, according to which the division between the White and the Blue Ordus only applies to the eastern part of the Ulus Juchi.
Accordingly, the White Orda is defined as the ulus of the eldest son of Juchi Ordu Ichen in the territory between Irtysh and Syrdariyo (see Ulus Orda-Egena) and is regarded as the nucleus of a modern Kazakh State.[3] The capital is the city of Sygnac.
Territorial coverage
In the Turkic languages, the word "ac" means "white," "holy", the word "cock" refers to a spectrum of colors from dark blue to light blue.
The Chinese divide the world into five colours: the north is black; the east is green; the west is white; the south is red; and the gold is the middle; in turn, the blue is the color of the sky, i.e. Tengri, the supreme god of the turquoise and the mongol.
The Ord's Axe was divided into two parts: the Western - North Primorhoria, Crimea, and Podonje, which took possession of Kuremsa, Nogai, and the Eastern - Voljier, the North Caucasus, which became the ownership of Batya, Berke, and other Juchids.
Ulus Orda Jezhena is the eastern wing of Ulus Juci, according to Grekov B. D., Jakubovsky, A. Y., and Fedorov-Davadova G.A.[1], which was in nominal dependence on the Golden Orda[2] and was administered by the descendants of Juchi's eldest son, Ord-Jehen.
In most scientific works, the name is Blue Orda.
Coc Orda) (some sources call the White Orda (Ac Orda)). In fact, he was an autonomous state.
In 1309, Orda-Jehena became Kok Orda at the Khan of Sasa Bug.
Since 1361 he has become an independent state under Urus Khan.
The stability of power in the empire during the reign of Munke Khan (1251–1259), including Ulus Juci, where the sons of Juchi-Ord Edgen and Batu, in parallel to the western and eastern parts of the State, ensured the stability of the transfer of power for a period of time.
Orda Edgen's heir, his fourth son Kung Kiran, was appointed to the throne by his father.
The succession process has resulted in a bloody war, and the throne was to be occupied by Bayan, the eldest son of Konichi, but for two years (1301–1302), the Khan Throne is seized by a representative of another line of descendants of Orda Edgen-Kublouk, son of Timur-Buka (grandson of Orda Edgen).
In an effort to remove Kubluk from the throne, Bayan (Senior Son of Konichi) sought help from the Khan of the Golden Order, Tohte.
Han Tohta did not provide military support to Bayan by using the label of his rightful ruler, Ulus Ord Jehen.
As a result of the decisive battle between the rivals of the throne, Bayan's army held up, but Kubluk was killed in battle.
After Shiban's death in 1280, Ulus Ord-Jehen was joined by Ulus Shiban.
Five years later, his younger brother, Mangatai (Makuday), who had taken over the eastern part of the State, rose up against Bayan.
Bayan was forced to retreat to the West.
Mangytai was declared Khan of Ulus Ord Jehen and the rules for two years until 1310.[1]
Ulus Territory
In 1377, Ulus Ord Jegen was attacked by Tamerlan himself, but the battle did not take place because of Urus Khan's sudden death (according to Chingiz-nam, he was killed by the son of Tokhtamish Jalal Al-Din during a small clash).[1]
The Ulus was located in the west of Mount Mugojara, north of the Siberian forest, and in the east was the Irtysh River, and in the south the Syr Darya River and Lake Balkhash.
The Ural River became the border in the west following the unification of the ulouse Shiban.
In Western Siberia, which belonged to Ulus Shiban, the State of Kéréit, the Taibugin Jurt, was established, and the capital of the Ulus is Signak.
In his lifetime, he was put by his father on the golden throne, on the throne of Ulus Ord Jeff, and tore down one of Tokhtamish's armies.

After graduating from the second school in Yakutsk, he worked as a teacher in his home Ulus (1922–1924).
He studied shamanism and there were nations of debt and Nganasan.
He himself accepted the customs and ways of life of the Nganasan.
In the 1930s, he conducted field studies on the Timer peninsula.
Among his informants were the Nganasan shamans, the Ngeda, from whom he recorded several autobiographys (as he himself called them).
The three autobiographs have been published in their entirety and contain descriptions of visions during the shaman disease, as well as genealogical information, an explanation of the meaning of certain ceremonies and ritual attributes, space tours, etc.
Portrait of M.V. Lomonosov, 1750.
His work supplies, including a transporter, are on the table.
Transporter reciprocally incorporated with an equilateral rectangular triangle
Transporter (fr. transporteur, from lat. transporto "carry") is a tool for building and measuring angles.
The transporter consists of a linear scale (directiline scale) and a semi-circle (glomeral scale) divided by degrees between 0 and 180°.
Some models range from 0 to 360°.
Transporters are made of steel, plastics, wood and other materials and the accuracy of the transporter is directly proportional to its size (the larger the transporter, the less the price of one division and the corresponding accuracy is higher).
It is assumed that the measurement of angles was already in ancient Babylon, as evidenced by the finding of circles that were allegedly used for this purpose.
These circles were supposedly parts of primitive astrolabes.
The ancient astrological calendar of King Sargon and the table of lunar eclipses from 747 B.C.E. of Babylon's origin were also preserved.
All of this was to include a certain number of angular measurements.[1]
It is also known that the Babylonites have somehow divided the circle into 360 parts and the day has also been divided into 360 parts.[2]
In addition, the temple records of the city of Uruk of the end of 4,000 B.C.E. indicate a 12-month division of the year by 30 days, that is, 360 days, and a reference to such a division in the later Myth of Enuma Elish.[3]
Cassan's on the ground.
Preparation of the madman
Kazan (from Turkic, Azerb. qazan, Kazan; Kirg. Kazan; tat. kazan, Kazan, kuzon, kuzan, and Turkm. gazan) is a traditional Asian metallic boiler with a semi-circular cooking floor.
The largest ones are used for cooking large amounts of meat, called tai-casan (Tai — a child or a bull over a year old).
One of the well-known Thai-Casals is the Kazakh in the mausoleum of Ahmed Yasavi (Turkistan, Republic of Kazakhstan).
Ritual bronze tai-casan is located in the center of the mausoleum main hall.
For Muslims, the Kazakh was a symbol of unity and hospitality.
Therefore, particular importance was attached to its size and appearance.
The Turkish Kazakh has no equal in this respect.
Its diameter is 2.2 m, and its weight is 2 tons. According to the legend, the whole of seven metals, iron, zinc, lead, tin, red copper, silver, and gold, is used.
In literary sources, bronze alloy.
The casting of such a unique cassan required extraordinary skill.
Mr. Abdul-Gaziz-Sharafutdin-ula al-Tebresi was able to solve this complex problem, not only technologically, but also aesthetically, by casting the cassan.
The Casan is decorated with three belts with vegetable ornament and Arab moustache.
With the sausage handles, the master gave a fine shape to the lotus petals.
Kazan has spread in many Central Asian countries.
The traditional cassane is spilled out of metal and has a rounded bottom.
There are also shown to have a small plane on the base so that they can be placed on an even surface.
Cassan with thick walls is a used dish, and thick walls avoid burning food.
The main negative is the weight.
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Central Asia are the most widespread and widespread.
The round shape of the cassane is designed to lower into the fire and to heat not only the bottom (as is the case with flat bottom dishes) but the entire surface with spherical shape.
The contents of such dishes are heated faster and remain hot longer, allowing substantial fuel storage.
The cap is usually made of woodboards, which also contributes to energy conservation.
The word "casan" is a borrowing from the Turkish languages, where it has become a suffix derivative of the word "cow", which can be translated as "crawling, rubbing," meaning "cass" literally "scratched".[1]
Kazans are also called the hoarding holes on the board for the Turk's board game, the Toguz Corgool.
In another Turkic team horse game, the kok boru's head gate is tai-cazed.
Cassan on the metal oven.
Swimming preparation
Kazan is installed in fixed (stones, samurai, earthy), portable metallic areas of cylindrical shape, as well as in a special metallic tripod, the Tagan.
With the flames out, the dish is being put out in a hot spot for a while.
Bunk is usually a cylindrical receptacle with a wide opening at the top, unlike a bottle, with a sufficiently short and wide throat or no throat at all, with a lid intended to store various products.[1]
At present, banks are mainly made of glass, plastic and metal.
The metal cans are made up of tin (steel) and aluminium.
Notes
Banks are designed to store liquid, semi-liquid, splashy or solid substances, especially foodstuffs, medicines and various technical substances.
Food cans include canned, beer, jam cans, and other products.
Banks are used as refillable packagings or as a single packaging.

The history of the glass bank
As a package of glass packagings is known from deep ancient times.
Glass bottles and bottles were used in Egypt and Syria as early as the fourth millennium before the new era.
In 1824, the invention of printed glass initiated the production of glass packagings on an industrial scale.
Glass bottles were first produced, then glass cans were produced.[2]
The idea of using glass cans for preservation (as well as the food preservation method itself) belongs to the French cook and pastry confectioner Upper.
His invention of 1804 was introduced in 1809 at the Society for the Promotion of Arts in Paris.
The conclusion of the special commission set up to examine the results of the invention was positive.
And for his invention, Upper received a reward from Napoleon.
In Russia, the first glass mills appeared in the 17th century, but the real bloom of Russian glassmaking began in the 18th century.
In the early 18th century, nine small factories were already operating in Karachevsk, Sevsk and Trubchevsk counties, which produced "slope simple bubbles" and "white and simple slope".[4]
The large-scale glass-tar production was established by the 19th century.[2]
After the revolution, by the end of the 1930s, the Soviet authorities were able to convert glass production to new management techniques, producing glass and selling large quantities of cans.[5][6]
The quality (including the transparency of glass) and the size of the cans were regulated by special standards.
[7] The range was represented by: 0.2 litres (so-called &quot; mayonnaise &quot; ); 0.5 litres; 0.7 litres; 1 litres; 1.5 litres; 2 litres; 3 litres; 10 litres[5][8].

The similar word "gurun" from a Nana language belonging to the same group has a similar meaning.
The History of Race Mixing
The Russians, living in the same territory as the indigenous population — buryats and Ewenca — often assimilate with them, gradually acquired certain anthropological characteristics and borrowed elements of the welfare and culture of these peoples.
But when faced with new environmental and economic conditions in close contact with other peoples, they generally did not lose their language and their consciousness.
Vasili Yakovlevich Yerošenko (December 31, 1889 (12 January 1890), Sloboda Obukhovka, Oldoskosk County, Kurski Province, Russian Empire – December 23, 1952) was an Esperanthic writer, poet, musician, teacher, and well-known essays in Esperanto and Japan.
The Destiny of Yerosenko is devoted to the documentary and artistic tale of A. Kharkovsky, "The Man Who Sees the World" (1978); the books of Edward Pashnev, "The Sun is His Guide" (1971), "The Hope of Gordienko-Andriana," "The Sleeping of Me at the Hearts of the World" (1973, 1977), A. Polakovsky, "The Blind Pilgrim" (2000).
The home of the Yerošenko family was moved to Old Oskol (No. 98 on 8 March).
As the current tenants refused to sell the house, the authorities of Obuchovka built an exact copy in the author &apos; s home village,[2] where the Yeroshenko Literary and Memorial Museum has been located since 1990.[3]
His name is the street in the north-east part of the city of Old Oskol.

During the Embassy, Witsen systematically kept a diary, made notes, sketches of the species of Moscow, Novgorod, Pskov, and many notable buildings.

Work of life
For 25 years, Witsen worked on a synthesis of his travel notes on Russia, and in 1690 published the first detailed map of Siberia in Europe, named by him, according to the tradition prevailing in European mapping, "Tartaria" (lat.
Tartaria, Frances Tartarie, English.
Tartary, him.
Tartarei).
This map was the first to show Russian ownership in Asia and to start a scientific study of Siberia, maintaining its significance throughout the 18th century.
The Witsen map showed the Kamchatka River, so this is the first written reference to Kamchatka as such, although this land was discovered by B. Atlas only after 30 years.[1]
In 1692, Witsen released in Amsterdam a comprehensive compilation of "Noord en Oost Tartarye", the first in Western Europe to be a detailed ethnographic and geographic description of the Siberian lands and their inhabited peoples.
He then worked for another 10 years to supplement this work and released his second edition in 1705.
Not only did he learn all the sources of information available to him, but he also gathered up-to-date information about the region through his extensive network of informants in Europe, Russia, and Asia, thanks to his influence in Europe.

Relations with Russia
In 1693 he began trading with Russia.
He had extensive knowledge of Russian culture and society.
Indirectly took part in the teaching of the Dutch language by King Peter I, through his close friend and his marriage to Vitsen, a relative of Andries (Andrea) Vinus.[1]
Vitsen's sympathy for Peter I's reforms was due to the fact that the Borgmestre led a so-called "prorussian lobby" in the Netherlands, as opposed to political groups in The Hague, who feared that the expansion of Russian territory would destroy Dutch-Swedish business ties.[8]

Nikolaas Witsen (May 8, 1641 (1641-05-08) – August 10, 1717] was a Dutch politician, businessman, cartographer, bourgmestre of Amsterdam from 1682 to 1706 (13 terms) and manager of the East India Company.
Traveling through Russia
From 1664 to 1665, N. Witsen visited the Russian State for the first time,[4] as part of the Dutch Embassy of Jacob Boreil.
Jermaq Timofevich (1532 – 6 August 16) was a Cossack ataman, the historic conqueror of Siberia for the Russian State.
According to historian Siberia at the end of the 17th century, the author of the same-named record of Semyon Remezov, whose father, the Tobol shooter, V. M. Remezov, saw the survivors of the famous ataman personally, the latter being "beasts of courage and reason, and of man and man, and of all wisdom satisfied, flats, black brads and hairs, mid-aged age, and flat, and shoulderbrush."[7]
The same text states that Hermak's name is Pololski or Pololski, and that the real name is Herman.[9] Other historians and recorders make his name from Jerema (Jeremy).
Yermak fought in the Livon War, commanding the Cossack's 100.
Under the leadership of the Voivodeship, Dmitri Khvorostinin participated in a successful trip to Lithuania in 1581, went down the Dnieper to Mogilev and fought in the Battle of Shklov.
A letter from Lithuanian Commander Mogileva Stravinsky, sent at the end of June 1581 to King Stefan Batorius, referred to "Hermak Timofeevich - Ataman Kozacsky"[1]
In the autumn of the same year, Ermak participated in the lifting of the siege of Pskov, followed by the Battle of the Lialians in February 1582, in which the Russian army led by Xorstinin stopped the Swedish movement.
According to Ruslan Sprannikov, Yermak fought under the leadership of Xorstin ten years earlier in the Battle of the Young Men in the unit of Don's Ataman Michael Cherkachenin.[17]
In 1582, a comrade of Cossacks (more than 540) gathered under the leadership of Atamans Jermak Timofeevich, Ivan Rolz, Yakov Mihailov, Nikita Pan, Matway Mashkorjak, Cercasa Alexandrova and Bogdan Brazga was invited by the Ural Stroganov to defend herself against regular attacks by the Siberian Khan of Kuchum and went up the Kama River, and in June 1582 she arrived on the Chusova River, in the Chusovian towns of the Strogan brothers.
The Cossacks lived here for two months and helped Stroganov protect their towns from burglary by the Siberian Khan Kuchum.

On September 1, 1581, a well-equipped cossack friend under the command of Jermak marched for the Stone Belt (Ural) from the Strogan Town residence[18] by waterway on Kama, Chusov and Serebrianka.[19]
In another version proposed by historian R. G. Sprannikov, the Jermak, Ivan Ring and Nikita Pan's trip to Siberia dates back to 1582, as peace with the Pospolitan speech was concluded in January 1582, and at the end of 1581 Ermak still fought with the Lithuanians.[20]
The campaign, according to Esipovsky and Remizovsky's records, was owned by Ermak himself, and Stroghanov's involvement was limited to the forced supply of supplies and weapons to the Cossacks.
According to the Strogan Book (taken by Karamzin, Solovyov and others), the Stroghanovs themselves called the Cossacks from Volga to Chusova and sent them on a camping trip, joining the Jermak group (540 men) with 300 men from their properties.[21][22]
Han Kuchum of the Sheibanid family was a relative of Khan Abdullah, who ruled in Bucharest.
In 1555, the Siberian Khan of the Tybugin tribe, after hearing of the Russian State's conquest of Kazani and Astrahani, voluntarily agreed to accept Russian citizenship and pay a small tribute to Russian King Ivan IV.
But in 1563, Kuchum staged a coup, killing Jediger and his brother Beckbulat.
Having seized power in Kashlyk, Kuchum played a clever diplomatic game with Moscow for the first few years, promising to obey, while delaying the payment of the gift.
According to the Remezian record, Kuchum installed his power in Western Siberia with extreme cruelty.
This led to the lack of confidence of the Vogul troops (mansi), the sanctuaries (hants) and other indigenous peoples who were forcibly assembled by them in 1582 to reflect the Cossack invasion.
It was not until the spring of 1582 that the rivers of Geravle, Baranche and Tagilu of the Cozaks sailed to Touru.
They smashed the Siberian Tatars twice, on Tour and at Tawda's mouth.
Kuchum sent Mametkul against the cossacks, with a large army, but on 1 August, the army was smashed by Ermak on the shore of Tobola, at Babasana's truancy.
Finally, on Irtysh, under Chuvashev, the Cossacks finally defeated the Tartars in the Battle of the Chuvasheva Cape.
Kuchum left a notice protecting the main city of his sanity, Siberia, and fled south to Ishim's steppes.
On 26 October (5 November) 1582, Jermak entered the Tartar-dwelling city of Siberia (Kashalik).[24]
Four days later, the hants from the Demianchi River, the right tributary of the lower Irtysha, donated to the Cossacks pukes and food supplies, mainly fish.
Hermac met them and released them with honor.
Local Tatars who had fled from the Russians had reached out for the hanttles.
Hermac received them with the same affection, allowed them to return to their villages, and promised to protect them from enemies, especially Kuchum.
Then they came with cannony and food from the left-hand neighborhoods — from the Konda and Tawda rivers.
All of Ermac's fellows were required to serve as a Yasaka every year.
From the "best people" (tribal top), Ermak took the "horse" — an oath that their "people" would pay the crèche in a timely manner.
They were then considered subjects of the Russian king.[24]
In December 1582, Warlord Kuchuma, Mametkul, killed a Kazakh group in Abalatsk Lake from an ambush, but on 23 February, the Cosaki attacked Kuchum again, taking Mametkula captive on the Wagae River.
There is no doubt that Ermak was a man of outstanding intelligence and character, as both his fellow believers and his opponents acknowledged, and he was certainly a legendary person.
In the summer of 1583, Ermak used the cities of Tartar and the hives on the rivers Irtysh and Obi, met with persistent resistance everywhere, and took over the city of Nazim of Ostan.
After taking over the city of Siberia (Kashalik), Ermak sent the racers to Stroganov and the ambassador to the king, Ataman Ivan Ring.
Ivan Grozny received him very nicely, gave him a rich gift to the Cossacks, and sent Prince Semyong Bolkhovsky and Ivan Glukhov to support them, with 300 of them.
Among the royal gifts sent to Siberia by Ermak were two rings, including a ring once belonging to Prince Peter Ivanovich of Shui.
The present came in handy, and Ermak carried both rings, according to his companions, day and night, as he continued his difficult journey.
The King's Voivodes arrived at Ermak in the fall of 1583, but their unit could not deliver substantial help to the much-deterred Cossack friend in battles.
Atamans were killed one after another: Bogdan Brazga was first ambushed; Nikita Pan was killed when Nazim was taken; and in the spring of 1584 the Tatars killed Ivan Ring and Yakov Mikhaylov.
Ataman Matvei Meshek was besieged in his camp by Tatars, and only with great losses forced their leader, Karacha, Kucuma's Viser, to retreat.
Hermak's death
According to one of the traditions, he was from the banks of the Chusovaya River.
Thanks to the knowledge of the local rivers, he walked through Kama, Chusova, and even moved to Asia, on the Tagil River, until he was taken away to serve (Cherepan's record).
According to another version, he was a native of the Kachalin dance on Don (Bronevsky).[3]
According to the research by A. P. Abatnikov, Ermac is a native of the Russian North.

Kashlyk () is a city in the capital city of Siberia, Sibir, Siber, Iber, Izker.
He was on the right bank of Irtysh when a small river of Siberia arrived, 17 km above modern Tobolsk.
It is now a monument to the archaeology "Kuchumov City".
The city of Isker was born before the Mongolian invasion.
The territory of the city, like the entire land of Siberia, has been inhabited on several occasions by different tribes and peoples, presumably since the bronze age (I a thousand years B.C.E.).
In its time, the land was called "Kashlyk", as well as "Sibir", from the name of the ancient Sabir people, who once settled the territory of Zauralia.[2]
By the beginning of the 13th century, Izker was already a significant settlement.
According to sources, in 1224, among the other properties of Chenghishan, Ibir-Siber was also transferred to Uluce Juchi.[4]
Isker was the capital of the Sibir sanity in the late 15th and early 16th centuries.

On 17 March 2023, an arrest warrant was issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague against Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation.
The current President of Russia was charged with a war crime of unlawful deportation of children from the occupied territories of Ukraine to Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[3]
Putin became the third acting head of State and the first permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[4] whose arrest the ICC requested.
Prior to that, the ICC had brought charges against President Omar Al-Bashir of the Sudan and the ruler of Libya, Muammar Qadhafi.[5]
Together with Putin, an arrest warrant was issued against Maria Lvvov-Belov, Commissioner to the President of the Russian Federation for the Rights of the Child.[6]
On 30 May, Russian President Putin facilitated the extradition of Russian citizenship to Ukrainian orphans.[24]
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine stressed that this was "the actual legal basis for the abduction of children".[24]
The UN Commission has characterized the deportation of Ukrainian children as a war crime.[29]
According to Reuters, after the issuance of a warrant by Putin and Lviv Belovu, they may arrest and transfer the ICC to any of the 123 countries that have ratified the Rome Statute.[7]
Responses
Russia
The reaction of representatives of the Russian authorities has been violent and emotional, even though they have claimed that the ICC decision for Russia is "legally null and void".[32] According to the Press Secretary, Kremlin Dmitry Peskov,[33] and the official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Maria Zacharova, the court's decisions in terms of law in the Russian Federation are "nothing".[34]
Maria Lvova-Belova, commenting on her warrant, stated: "It is great that the international community has appreciated the work done to help our children."[33]
Deputy Sovbeza of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, wrote: "Do not explain how to use this paper [order]" by accompanying the post of emodzi with toilet paper.[34]
The first Vice-Chairman of the International Committee of the Federation Council, Vladimir Jabarov, stated that it would be "good" if the Basman District Court issued an arrest warrant to the full ICC membership.[34]
However, Russian opposition politicians such as Leonid Volkov and Vladimir Milov welcomed the ICC decision.[1]
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, stated: "A historic decision that would give rise to historical responsibility, such a criminal operation would not have been possible without an order from the highest leader of the terrorist State."
Other Ukrainian officials also indicated that the decision had become historic and noted its fairness.[1]
West
President Joe Biden of the United States stated that Putin was clearly guilty of war crimes and that his arrest warrant was justified.[1]
The European Union's Supreme Representative, José Borrel, reported: "The decision of the International Criminal Court to issue a warrant for the arrest of Vladimir Putin for a war crime — the illegal deportation and transfer of children from Ukraine to Russia — is the beginning of a process to bring the perpetrators to justice.
We appreciate and support the work of the ICC.
There can be no impunity."[2]
Prime Minister Kay Callas of Estonia stated: "A step closer to the day of judgment.
With Putin's first arrest warrant, the ICC sends a historic signal: all atrocities against Ukraine stem from the criminal policy of the Russian leadership.
It is a reminder that no one is insured, not even heads of State.
The Russian regime will be held accountable."[32] The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Latvia, the Netherlands, France[36] also expressed support for the ICC decision.[4][32]
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish stated that Putin did not become a person of non grata and he remains ready to speak to him on important issues.[35]
